Attribution Requirement: In any distribution, public display, public use,

works), you must give appropriate credit to the original author by
including the following information in a visible location (for example, in a
`NOTICE` file, application "About" screen, or documentation) and in any
accompanying distribution material:

- The text: "Based on terrariaRAG by Alexander040105"
- A link or reference to the original repository when reasonably possible.
- A copy of this LICENSE file or a clear reference to its location.

This attribution must appear in a manner that is reasonable to the medium
and means of distribution (for example, in source distributions include the
attribution near the top-level README or in binary distributions include it
in an about dialog or accompanying documentation).

NO OTHER CONDITIONS. The above attribution requirement is the only
condition placed on use of the Software. This license aims to be permissive

Notes:
- This is a custom attribution-first license drafted for this project.
- If you want an OSI-approved or well-known license with attribution semantics
  (for example: Apache 2.0 requires preservation of NOTICE entries), consider
  switching to that established license instead. I can help replace this with
  a standard license and add a `NOTICE` file if you prefer.
