51,Accessories,Introduction,"Accessories (aka equipable items)are equipable items that can providestatboosts and/or special abilities such as limited flight. Accessories must be placed in a character's equip accessory slots to work, with the exception of someinformational accessorieswhich work simply by being in a character's inventory.",paragraph,Accessories.html
52,Accessories,Introduction,"InJourneyand Normal mode worlds it is possible to benefit from five accessories simultaneously (given there are no override effects - for example, it is not possible to wear more than one pair ofwingsat the same time). InExpert Modea sixth slot is obtainable by consuming aDemon Heart. Ultimately,Master Modeincludes a sixth slot by default which, when combined with a Demon Heart, provides seven slots. Neither the Demon Heart slot nor the Master Mode slot is functional in Normal mode worlds, and both will only function when the difficulty is set to the corresponding level in Journey Mode worlds.",paragraph,Accessories.html
53,Accessories,Introduction,"No duplicate accessories may be equipped, but theTinkerer's Workshopcan combine many accessories together into new accessories with multiple effects. For example,Hermes Boots(or another similar accessory) andRocket Bootscan be crafted intoSpectre Boots.",paragraph,Accessories.html
54,Accessories,Introduction,"Each accessory slot also has a respectivevanityslot (as well as adyeslot) which allows a character to equip twice the amount of accessories for cosmetic or storage purposes. Accessories can be set to be invisible on the wearer but still provide their buffs. Additionally, with the 1.4.4 Labor of Love update, characters can have 3 different loadouts, each with their own unique Accessory & Vanity Accessory slots, increasing the total amount of accessories one could store to 36.",paragraph,Accessories.html

57,Accessories,Modifiers[],"Most accessories (and weapons) can havemodifiersaffecting the user's (or weapons') statistics. Most eligible items will get a modifier upon creation, but an item can also gain one later, or have its modifier changed: ""Reforging"" is a service provided by theGoblin Tinkererat sometimes-considerable cost. Modifiers provide bonuses that are broadly useful, such as movement speed or increased defense, for as long as the item is equipped (this is also required for someinformational accessorieswhose special effects work without being equipped). Accessories can only get bonuses from modifiers, never penalties. Accessory modifiers can provide from 1 to 4 points of defense, 20 points of mana capacity, or from 1%-4% bonus on any of several stats: Damage (for any attack), critical strike chance (any attack except summons), movement speed, or melee speed.  In all cases, the bonus applies only when the item is worn in a non-vanity accessory slot.  Modifier bonuses stack freely, all worn items will accumulate.  Thus by reforging all 5 /6/7allowed accessories to the same modifier, a player can have their choice of +100 /120/140mana capacity, +20 /24/28defense, or +20% /24%/28%on one of the affected statistics.",paragraph,Accessories.html
58,Accessories,Notes[],"All informational items except the mechanical ones combine into thePDA, taking one watch for all of them. Nearly all the mechanical accessories (except theRuler), combine intoThe Grand Design. Similarly, most of the status-resistance items (and two related items) combine into theAnkh Shield. (Notable exceptions:Hand  Warmer).",list,Accessories.html
59,Accessories,Notes[],"Although it is possible to equip an accessory and its materials at the same time, such asSpectre BootsandHermes Boots, their effects will not necessarily combine. Stat-boost items are more likely to stack with their own components (for example, the various Emblems), but this is not universal. Check the items' respective pages for which accessories can stack their effects.",list,Accessories.html
60,Accessories,Notes[],"Informational accessories (notably all components of thePDA) do not have to be worn in the accessories slot. They will still provide information if they are in the player's main inventory, but their modifiers will have no effect.",list,Accessories.html
61,Accessories,Notes[],"Equipping an accessory which provides immunity to a certain debuff will alsoremovethe debuff if the player is suffering it. This can be a lifesaver, especially if Autopause is turned on.",list,Accessories.html
62,Accessories,Notes[],"It is useful if you have spare vanity accessory slots, to put ""backup"" accessories in them. (Again, Autopause is helpful.) For example, theMegaphonecan be placed in the vanity slot; if you get silenced, just swap the Megaphone in to clear the debuff (and if autopaused, exit the inventory for a moment to restart time). Then just switch back as needed. This also makes it easier to swap in swimming buffs when taking to the water.",list,Accessories.html

Armor pieces are equipped by placing them in the armor slots of the player'sinventory. Armor can also be placed invanity slotsto change the player's appearance without affecting stats. Armor pieces are eithercrafted, purchased fromNPCs, or dropped from enemies.",paragraph,Armor.html
312,Armor,Introduction,"Each piece of armor has adefensestatistic that reduces inflicted damage by half /75%/allits value, rounded up. For example, a full set ofCopper armorprovides a total of 6 defense, reducing damage by 3 /5/6points.Silver armorgrants a total of 13 defense, reducing damage by 7 /10/13points, after having been rounded up. An attack cannot normally be reduced to zero; all attacks will always deal at least 1 damage (or 2 damage for acritical hit), regardless of the quality of a player's armor. The only times an attack can do 0 damage is if the player has invincibility for whatever reason or there is another player on the same team with thePaladin's Shieldequipped and the attack does 1 damage normally.",paragraph,Armor.html
313,Armor,Introduction,"In addition to the defense provided by individual armor pieces, most armor types provide aSet Bonuswhen all three pieces of the same armor type are worn simultaneously. For the basicpre-Hardmodeorearmors (CopperthroughPlatinum), this is an additional defense bonus. More advanced or unique armors can provide other specialized set bonuses (e.g.,  theShroomite armorwill provide invisibility when not moving).[source 1]",paragraph,Armor.html

456,Armor,Notes[],"The default Hardmode ore armors (Cobalt,Mythril, andAdamantite) are often mistaken as direct downgrades to the others (Palladium,Orichalcum, andTitanium).

The default Hardmode ore armors also do not require as many bars to create, making swift progression easier.",list,Armor.html
457,Armor,Notes[],"For most Hardmode armors with helmet variants, the helmets sell for more than other pieces of their respective sets, despite needing fewer bars to make.

Despite manymodifiersand effects showing changes to attack or melee speed, attack speed is not an in-game statistic and is instead determined by its reciprocal, known asuse time. This is the amount time it takes to swing (attack with) or use an item. If use time increases, attack speed decreases, and vice versa. For example, a weapon with a use time of 30 will have a lower attack speed (slower rate of fire) than a weapon with a use time of 10. As such, any attack speed modifiers will in actuality act as a variable within theuse time equation. However, as shown below, for many melee weapons a change in attack speed (and therefore use time) will have effects other than a change in use time.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
566,Attack speed,Introduction,"While almost all weapons can receive attack speed modifiers, such as Quick or Legendary, accessories will only ever provide bonuses to melee speed.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html

568,Attack speed,Effects on special types of melee weapons[],"Melee speed bonuses affect different types ofmelee weaponsin different ways. For most endgame weapons, it does not increase DPS, as most of them fall into one of the following categories:",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
569,Attack speed,Projectile melee weapons[],"Melee speed only affects the actual swinging animation and not the rate at which a weapon fires projectiles, with few exceptions such as theTerra Blade. In other cases, however, the speed at which the projectile fires is the same regardless of having +10% melee speed or +200% melee speed. Melee speed does, however, affect the speed at which the projectile travels. TheTerragrim,Arkhalis, andStarlight's main attacks are considered projectiles, and do not benefit from melee attack speed boosts.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
570,Attack speed,Yoyos[],"Melee speed bonuses increase the length of aYoyo's string, but not its attack rate. This can be very helpful in the early game, when yoyos are very short and hard to hit bosses with, and against bosses where you need to keep a distance (such asEmpress of Light). The exact multiplier for yoyo string length is(1+3*(melee speed))/4, where melee speed is1.0without buffs. Thus, if the player can reach 2x melee speed through buffs, the yoyo string will be 75% longer.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
571,Attack speed,Flails[],"Similar to yoyos,Flailsdo not attack more often with melee speed boosts, but they reach further and shoot out faster, making them much better at hitting flying targets.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
572,Attack speed,Whips[],"Despite doing summoning damage,Whipsare heavily affected by melee speed, making them one of the few endgame weapons whose DPS is directly affected by melee speed.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
573,Attack speed,Spears[],"Spears gain additional reach from melee speed but not additional DPS. Instead, they move faster during each swing to make up for the increased travel distance.",paragraph,Attack_speed.html
574,Attack speed,Boomerangs[],Boomerangs gain additional range from melee speed.,paragraph,Attack_speed.html
575,Attack speed,Notes[],"The maximum increased attack speed (for melee) is +158.1% usingMonk's Bushy Brow Bald Cap(20%),Shinobi Infiltrator's Torso(20%),Solar Flare Leggings(15%),Exquisitely Stuffed(buff) (10%),Tipsy(buff) (10%), and the five accessoriesFeral Claws(12%),Power Glove(12%),Mechanical Glove(12%),Celestial Shell(15.1% at night) andBerserker's Glove(12%), each reforged toViolent(20%). InExpert ModeViolentFire Gauntletcan be worn for an extra 16%, with +174.1% total; InMaster Modean additional Violent accessory (note, as of 1.4, the sun and moon stones' effects no longer stack) can be worn for an extra 4%, with +178.1% total. When combined with the fastest melee weapon, theFetid Baghnakhs, a player may execute a full melee attack in roughly 0.033 seconds, or thirty times per second (note:as of 1.4, it can only receive up to +25% speed bonus).",list,Attack_speed.html
576,Attack speed,Notes[],"Mining speedof various tools is however not affected by the bonuses above, it is only boosted by specialized mining bonuses (such as theMining PotionandMining armor) and speed bonuses granted by the tool's ownmodifier, the best of which is Light. The exception is theCelestial Stone(and related accessories), whose bonus to mining speed is stated in the tooltip.",list,Attack_speed.html
577,Attack speed,Notes[],"Enemies' invincibility frames should be taken into consideration when dealing with attack speed. Generally speaking, no invincibility time is applied when referring to projectiles that do not pierce, but those that do pierce or explode are not in this case. Normally it is 1/6 seconds (10 ticks[1]) while there are some exceptions ranging from 5 ticks to 20 ticks.",list,Attack_speed.html
578,Attack speed,Footnotes[],"↑A tick is a time unit countable by the software. Most ofTerraria's updating logic happens every tick. A tick has the length of 1/60th of a second, hence there are 60 ticks in a second and 3600 ticks in a minute.",list,Attack_speed.html
579,Bars,Introduction,Barsarecrafting materialsgenerally crafted from minedoresat aFurnace. Crafting most ore-related items requires that raw ores are first crafted into bars.,paragraph,Bars.html
580,Bars,Introduction,"There are currently 23 different bar types. Obtaining most of these only requires their respective ores as crafting ingredients.Hellstone,Spectre, andShroomite Barsare exceptions that require a secondary material in addition.Hallowed Barsare not crafted but are instead dropped by themechanical bosses. Some bars may also be obtained  fromcrates.",paragraph,Bars.html
581,Bars,Notes[],"Bars can be placed likefurniture, take up a space of one tile, and can be stacked on top of each other. When placed in this manner, they can be used just likeplatforms, to stand on and drop down from, and furniture can be placed on the top (torchesalso to the sides).",list,Bars.html
582,Bars,Notes[],"Bars cannot be placed without another block underneath them; this makes it impossible to build a house made of bars without the aid of other blocks. This mechanic makes breaking bars similar to cutting downtrees, where breaking the bottom bar in a stack will break all bars above it.The only way to make placed bars ""float"" would be to abuse the fact thatchestswith items inside cannot be destroyed. Using bars as support under such a chest would mean they cannot be destroyed until the chest is emptied. This allows them to float in-air without any supporting blocks.Note: The duplication glitch with bars and a chest was patched long ago in 1.1",list,Bars.html

This can be proven by placing 125 Hallowed blocks in an otherwise completely neutral area, observing that the area will change to Hallowed on placement of the 125th block, then that it will return to neutral on placement of a Crimson or Corruption block, then back to Hallowed on placement of an additional Hallowed block, ad infinitum.",list,Biomes.html

For example, most bosses have associatedsummoning itemsthat can be used to spawn them manually under certain conditions, while there are others that will appear after the player interacts in a certain way with the environment.Eventbosses will only appear during their respective events and leave when the event ends.

1654,Buffs,Introduction,"Buffsare positive status effects granted to a player upon consuming, equipping, or otherwise activating various items. Active buffs are shown as icons below thehotbar, along with their remaining duration. Buffs are almost universally positive or at least benign effects, in contrast withDebuffs, over which the player has much less control.",paragraph,Buffs.html
1655,Buffs,Introduction,"Buffs can be easily activated with the buffhotkey(defaultBon PC), which activates all the buff-granting consumables in the player's inventory (starting from the top-left) that are not currently activated. A player is limited to 22 (44 as of the 1.4.4 update ) (10) active buffs and debuffs at any one point, and the leftmost buff in the bar will be deactivated if another is applied after this limit is reached. Most Buffs can be deactivated prematurely by right-clicking their icon, though those that are granted by proximity to an item will only deactivate when the player is no longer in range (seeEnvironmentalbelow).",paragraph,Buffs.html
1656,Buffs,Introduction,"Activated buffs are bound to a character, and persist as that character moves from server to server and from world to world. With the exception of those granted byFlasks, buffs are always deactivated on the player'sdeath, though even Flasks are terminated along with the player in theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version, andNintendo3DSversion.",paragraph,Buffs.html

Since they cannot be canceled by right clicking them, the only way to remove the buff is to leave the area (with the exception of honey).",paragraph,Buffs.html

1662,Buffs,Notes[],"There is a known issue with the timers of buffs and debuffs. A buff/debuff's timer will usually round down to the next full minute, until there is less than 1 minute remaining. If a buff has a remaining duration of 4:35, it will display a duration of 4 minutes. However, when the duration has between 1:59 and 1:00 remaining, the timer will display there are still 2 minutes left, instead of the expected rounded result of 1 minute. When the timer reaches 0:59, it will visually jump from 2 minutes to 59 seconds.The total duration of a buff is not affected. This has no major impact on gameplay & is purely visual.",list,Buffs.html

This means that you can now have one of any of those four categories all displaying at the same time. Previously, only one of those could ever be visible at a time (for instance, if you had visible wings, you could not ever see a cape, backpack, or tail).Combat Wrench now displays on the player regardless of what other backpacks are currently shown (it is its own category of back-draw)Angel Halo now functions like Unicorn Horn, in that it will be visible regardless of any other head equipment or vanity that is equippedAccessories which draw on the head have also been split into several subgroups, which will allow several of them to be worn simultaneously.

Due to the shape of the Skull not fitting standard ""Terrarian face"" shapes, on certain helmets, it will use a different sprite with a more standard layout. You can also wear virtually all physically compatible Head/Face accessories with the Obsidian Skull as well.Ginger Beard has been resprited, and if set to visible, is now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face. It is also now compatible with most other Head/Face accessories.Reworked Shield/Cape display so that Shields and Capes are now visually compatible with each other again. The Shield now draws ""in front"" of the Cape, instead of underneath it, which led to many of the initial issues.Shields which are set to not be visible can still be dyed, and will show that dye when actively used (such as Shield of Cthulhu dash or Brand of the Inferno Block). Previously, if they were set to invisible, their active use version would never have dye.Long-player hair is now properly compatible with wings/backpacks, and will show the full length of the hair without being cut-off visuallyThe special trails left by various types of running boots (Sailfish Boots, Flurry Boots, Flower Boots, etc) are now also subject to vanity usage, and you can use the one you prefer either through re-ordering accessories or using the social slotsBone Glove now has visual vanity for the hand slotBalance ChangesBalancing changes have been introduced, in line with the PC version.

3506,Crafting,Introduction,"Craftingis the process of combiningmaterials(""ingredients"") into new items. It is one of the primary means of creating new weapons and tools and is thus generally indispensable for game progress. The entirety of an item's ingredients is called itsrecipe.",paragraph,Crafting.html
3507,Crafting,Introduction,"Crafting is done through the crafting bar, visible on the left side of the interface below the player'sinventory, which presents all craftable items available to the player. Items will only appear in this list if the player has the ingredients in their inventory. Pressing the⚒Use / Attackbutton on an item in the list will consume its required ingredients and place the item on the cursor, from which it can be placed in the inventory. Holding the⚷Interactbutton to craft a stackable item will begin to repeatedly produce the item until the stack is filled. Crafting takes no time, though there is a very small delay between the creation of items in a stack. The longer the button is held, the shorter this delay.",paragraph,Crafting.html
3508,Crafting,Introduction,"While many items can be crafted using only the materials in their recipes, most will require acrafting stationto make their recipe available. Items that require a station will appear in the crafting bar while the player stands near the required item, requiring no interaction with the station. In this way, a player may craft from multiple nearby stations at once.",paragraph,Crafting.html
3509,Crafting stations,Introduction,"ACrafting Stationallows players to craft various items. Entering theinventoryscreen displays the ""Crafting window"" in the lower-left, and when the player is standing near one or more Crafting Stations and possesses the right crafting ingredients, the bar is expanded with additional item choices.",paragraph,Crafting_stations.html

3521,Crafting stations,Crafting station reach[],"The player can reach any crafting station within ~3 blocks to their left or right, 3 blocks below them, or the 3 blocks of their character's height. This gives a total reach of ~8 by 6 blocks centered below the player. This is shorter than the player's reach for tools or chests of ~10 by 9 centered on the player.",list,Crafting_stations.html
3522,Crafting stations,Crafting station reach[],"Unlike the player's item reach, crafting reach cannot be extended by items such as theArchitect Gizmo PackorExtendo Grip. It can however be extended permanently by consuming theArtisan Loaf.",list,Crafting_stations.html
3523,Crafting stations,Crafting station reach[],"The crafting reach of the player isn't a whole number. If they press against a wall, they can reach a crafting station 4 blocks away, but they will never be able to reach 2 crafting stations 4 blocks away on either side. This can be easily tested by locking the player in a 2 wide space with crafting stations 4 blocks away on either side of them; they will only be able to reach 1 crafting station at any given time. Similarly, the player's item reach will extend to 5 blocks if pressed against a wall. Interestingly, the player has to be closer to the wall to extend item reach compared to crafting reach.",list,Crafting_stations.html

It can be inflicted by a multitude of entities, most prominentlyweapons,enemies, andNPCs(and all related projectiles). Furthermore, it can be caused by environmental hazards (such asthorny bushes,traps, orlava) andgame mechanics(such asfall damage,drowning, ordebuffs). Damage can generally only be inflicted on entities with a health statistic, i.e.,players, most enemies, and NPCs. Most damage sources additionally inflictknockbackon the damaged entity.",paragraph,Damage.html

3688,Damage,Piercing attacks against enemies[],"After being struck by such an attack, the enemy cannot take damage from another such attack for a brief period, usually 1/6 of a second (10 ticks[1]). Thus, when inlavaor when pierced by a persistent weapon such as aVilethorn, they can take damage at most 6 times a second. However, for multi-segmented enemies (usuallyworm types), this resistance applies to each segment separately, so such attacks can still strike multiple segments of a single enemy.

4146,Demolitionist,Trivia[],"The Demolitionist's appearance seems to be based ondwarvesfrom many games, films, and works of literature. He is significantly shorter than other NPCs and has a beard. His dislike of the Goblin Tinkerer also aligns with fictional rivalries between Dwarves and Goblins. Furthermore, his mining helmet, lantern, and the fact that he sellsexplosivesfits the trope of dwarves preferring undergroundenvironments. This is further proved by his Party-exclusive quote, one of his quotes while it is raining, his Happiness quote while in the Caverns, and his Bestiary entry. Several of his names are also references to dwarf characters in fiction:Beldin is from the five-book fantasy epicThe Belgariad.Durim is a corruption of Durin, a dwarven king mentioned in the books of English writerJ.R.R.

Some events also bring unique visuals and a unique atmosphere, such as an alteredMoonand noticeable shaders applied to the screen.

Some events also bring unique visuals and a unique atmosphere, such as an alteredMoonand noticeable shaders applied to the screen.

5449,Fishing,Introduction,"Fishingis accomplished by using aFishing Poleat a body ofliquid(water,honey, orlava) while havingbaitin the player'sinventory. While near the body of liquid, pressing the⚒Use / Attackbutton at a point over the liquid will cast a line into the liquid. Pressing the button again when the bobber moves up and down will reel in the line and often an item will come up with the line. TheAnglerNPC provides daily fishing quests and rewards their completion with an assortment of equipment, coins, potions, and vanity items.",paragraph,Fishing.html
5450,Fishing,Introduction,"Fishing provides resources: Crafting materials forpotionsandfood, a variety of very useful items such as mobility improvements like aFrog LegorBalloon Pufferfish, and even a petZephyr Fish. Throughcrates, fishing also provides an alternative source forores,coins, manychestitems (Sailfish Bootscan replaceHermesorFlurry Boots), and some specialties such as the powerfulFalcon Blade.",paragraph,Fishing.html
5451,Fishing,Introduction,"While fishing is not strictly necessary for game progression, some of the Angler's quest rewards (theFish Findercomponents) are required to complete theShellphone. Fishing is also required to fight thebossDuke Fishron. To summon the boss, aTruffle Wormmust be used as fishing bait in anOceanbiome.",paragraph,Fishing.html

5457,Fishing,Requirements[],"Surface width is determined first (green rectangle), then the depth below those tiles (arrows). Tiles falling outside the originally calculated surface width are not counted (red areas).",paragraph,Fishing.html
5458,Fishing,Requirements[],"75 connected tiles of liquid are required (1,001 forOceans, 50 forhoney) in order for fishing to work, and 300 or more tiles to be optimal (1,001 forOceans, 200 forhoney). The width of the top row of continuous liquid tiles (the row where the fishing bobber sits) determines the calculated pond width, and then the depth directly below those is counted. If the pond becomes wider at lower depths, that additional width isnotcounted. The player may successfully fish in a 1-tile-wide pond, as long as it's 75 tiles deep. The minimal required depth is 2 tiles.VerifyNothing will ever bite while the bobber is floating over a pond that's 1 tile deep and 300 tiles wide. The distance of the bobber to the shoreline does not matter. No fish will bite if the bobber can't fully come up and float on water. This can happen if a solid block is right above water level and is blocking the bobber. The bobber will also move horizontally while something is on the hook. If it ends up in a position where it can't float on top of water, nothing will be able to bite after.",paragraph,Fishing.html
5459,Fishing,Requirements[],"It is not possible to fish when the player is submerged in liquid, even partially, and even within a completely disconnected body of water. Fishing can, however, be done while moving, flying, whilegrappledto blocks, sitting on a chair, while floating on water with theSlime Mount, while mounted on a minecart, or while standing on top of the water, e.g. usingWater Walking Boots.",paragraph,Fishing.html
5460,Fishing,Requirements[],"Fishing can be done inLava, but will only work with theHotline Fishing Hook, aLavaproof Tackle Bag, aLavaproof Fishing Hook, or by using aMagma Snail,Lavafly, orHell Butterfly(which can be caught using aLavaproof Bug NetorGolden Bug Net). It can take much longer to get a bite in lava, but the chances increase with at least two of these sources; see theCatch Frequencysection below for details.",paragraph,Fishing.html
5461,Fishing,Fishing quests[],"Catching a quest fish for theAnglerNPCrequires fishing in the properbiome, andheightfor the day's current quest, which can be determined by talking to the Angler. Quest fish cannot be caught if the player already has that particular quest fish in their inventory, or if the quest fish was already turned in that day. However, if the player puts the Quest fish in a safe/bank then they may catch another Quest Fish. The player can then transfer the Quest Fish to a chest if they wish. TheAnglergives outspecial rewardswhen a proper quest fish is turned in. The player does not need to speak with him beforehand, nor have even encountered him, but the chances of finding the correct area to fish for a quest are much lower without speaking to him first. Each day, the angler will change his quest at 4:30AM.",paragraph,Fishing.html

5469,Fishing,Factors[],All the factors are combined into a totalFishing Powerthat determines the chances of higher-quality catches. Fishing Power is calculated by starting with adding these three basic factors:,paragraph,Fishing.html

5477,Fishing,Factors[],"Amounts in the tables below that influence fishing power are markedgreenorred. Because some of the bonus factors are percentages, the fishing power amounts given by any of the three basic factors can seem to vary depending on, e.g., time of day or weather.

Items with higher Bait Powers will tend to last through more fishing attempts: Higher Bait Power meanslowerchance of consumption.",list,Fishing.html
5480,Fishing,Factors[],"↑Chum Bucket bonuses are determined by how many are present on the water at once. One bucket used will give +11, two for +17 and three for a max of +20. These bonuses are not affected by previous factors (i.e. armor, accessories, potions, bait, pole, time, or weather), and are only affected by lake size. Also note that reeling in nothing or having the line break counts towards one of the 10 uses.",list,Fishing.html

6342,Golf,Introduction,Golfis an in-game activity whereplayershitGolf BallsintoGolf CupsusingGolf Clubs. Golf supplies can be purchased from theGolferNPC. Golf courses are not naturally-occurring and must be built.,paragraph,Golf.html
6343,Golf,Setting up[],"The player needs to obtain the following basic components to build their course: aGolf Ballof any color, anyGolf Club, aGolf Cup, and aGolf Teeto place the ball.",paragraph,Golf.html
6344,Golf,Playing[],"To play golf, the player should either place a Golf Tee and then put a ball on it by pressing⚷Interacton the tee, or just drop the ball on the ground. Then, they should use one of the four types of clubs to hit it, those being the Driver, the Iron, the Wedge, and the Putter. The goal is to get the ball into the hole in as few hits or ""strokes"" as possible. Using theGolf Whistlewill return the ball to its previous position with a one-stroke penalty.",paragraph,Golf.html
6345,Golf,Golf score[],"Separate from the regular golf scoring system of stroke count,golf scoreis a statistic used to track a character's overall experience with playing golf. The golf score is calculated based on the number of strokes used and the total of theEuclidean distancesof each shot. That is, by drawing a straight line between each location a shot is taken, and where the ball subsequently lands, the total distance will be the total length of all those lines, measured in feet. The calculated score is then rounded down before being added to the character's accumulated score. The exact score before rounding is calculated using the following formula:",paragraph,Golf.html

6359,Golf,Tips[],"The player can use the same level location for anOld One's Armyarena and driving range. Putting a tee at one end and a cup at the other can give the player plenty of points using the driver.If the player puts multiple Golf Cups followed by a large one-tile wide wall at the end, they can increase their one-shot chance significantly and therefore increase the score points they gain.

The player can simply put down aGolf Teeand use a Wedge or Iron club to launch the Golf Ball upwards. This has the added benefit of being faster and cheaper than most other early-game methods as the Golf Ball travels fast without any additional purchases needed for each shot.",list,Golf.html
6363,Golf,Tips[],"Using a Golf Tee will automatically place a Golf Ball on it even if the player has no Golf Balls in their inventory. If the player already has a tee, there is little reason for the player to buy Golf Balls unless todyeinto different colors.",list,Golf.html

The player can interact with most items by using, consuming, or placing them. Items are always in one of two forms: ""dropped"", i.e. being part of theworld, or in aninventorypertaining to a player,NPC vendor, orstorage item. Dropped items can usually be picked up by the player to move them into their inventory, and they can usually be dropped out of the inventory again.",paragraph,Items.html
7110,Items,Introduction,"Most items can be grouped based on certain shared characteristics, e.g.armoritems,blocks, orweapons. SeeCategory:Itemsfor the complete categorization.",paragraph,Items.html

7115,Items,Pickup[],"When an item is in its ""dropped"" form, any player making contact with the item will pick it up, automatically placing it in their inventory (if there is sufficient space). In addition, all players draw (""pull"") all items within a certain range towards them in order to make contact with them. This range is referred to aspickup range. It consists of a rectangular area of, by default, 5.25×5.25 tiles, centered on the player. Certain effects increase the pickup range for certain items:[1]",paragraph,Items.html
7116,Items,Pickup[],Effects/equipped items in the same row do not stack.,paragraph,Items.html
7117,Items,Pickup[],"""Pulled"" items have an acceleration and maximum speed, hence it is possible that an item is not pulled in completely, e.g. if the player is moving very fast and causes it to be out of pickup range before they could make contact with it.",paragraph,Items.html

If there are more than 400 ""dropped"" items on the world, items will also start despawning. In this instance, the items that have remained dropped for the longest amount of time may vanish as new items are added to the screen.",paragraph,Items.html

7125,Items,Buy/sell value[],Hovering over an item in the NPC's shop inventory will display the buy value. Hovering over an item in the player's inventory while the NPC's inventory screen is open will display its sell value. Items are always sold to vendors at 1/5 of their purchase price. Not all items have a sell value. Sales to (and purchases from) NPCs can be cancelled while the NPC's inventory screen is still open: Sold items can be taken back in exchange for the amount they were sold for (and purchased items can be sold back in exchange for the amount they were purchased for).,paragraph,Items.html

7270,Jungle,Hardmode[],"It is a good idea to section off the Jungle before activatingHardmode, or the Jungle might quickly be overtaken by theevil biome(Corruption/Crimson) and eventually be eliminated. The evil biome convertsMud Blockswithin a three-tile radius of any corrupted block to dirt, and growsCorrupt/Crimson grasson it. This means that simply digging a three-block wide tunnel around all sides of the Jungle will prevent the evil biome from spreading to it. Sincebackground wallscannot spread the evil biome (though they may get converted themselves), it is unnecessary to remove any walls that cross that three-block gap. However,thorny bushesmay grow as bridges across the tunnel for the evil biome to spread across, a longer-term tunnel would need to be at least fifteen blocks wide, since thorny bushes can grow up to six blocks in both Jungles and evil biomes.To learn more, seeBiome spread.However, it is very possible that, upon the defeat of theWall of Fleshand activation of Hardmode, the ""V"" shape created by the evil biomes including the Corruption/Crimson will breach the tunnel that one has built to contain the evil. Therefore, the aboveground Jungle may likely still be infected. To curb this, it may be a wise idea to instead spreadthe Hallowbetween the Jungle and evil biome by simply usingHoly Water(which is easily craftable upon the start of Hardmode). The Hallow cannot spread to the Jungle and will also block the Corruption and Crimson, making it a worthy alternative to digging a tunnel.The aboveground Jungle is generally far less important in terms of loot than theUnderground Jungle, which will also be much harder for the Corruption/Crimson to fully infect. Therefore, the player's main priority in terms of the Jungle will likely beNPChousing, which is especially important on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader versionwhere thePylon Networkwill make world travel far easier. It may be a wise idea to instead build one's Jungle base deep underground instead of aboveground, as it is far less likely that it will be infected by the evil biome due to the sheer size of the Underground Jungle. It will also give the player easier access to the Underground later in Hardmode, such as when setting up a Plantera arena.",list,Jungle.html

7768,Mana,Introduction,"Manais a resource consumed by the player when usingmagic weapons. Each magic weapon has a specific mana cost that depletes the player's mana upon use. When a player's mana is depleted completely, a magic weapon cannot be used again until that weapon's mana cost has regenerated.",paragraph,Mana.html
7769,Mana,Introduction,"Similar to playerHealth, the player's current mana supply and capacity are represented by a meter: a column of blue stars displayed on the top-right edge of the screen, with each star representing 20 mana. Mana regenerates automatically as long as the player is not firing a magic weapon. It fills more quickly if the player stands still, with a further rate boost based on the current total mana: The more mana a player has, the faster it regenerates.",paragraph,Mana.html

UsingMana Crystalsincreases the player's mana capacity by 20 permanently, adding another star to the meter. This can be done up to 9 times, which in addition to the 1 initial star makes 10 stars total, representing 200 mana.",paragraph,Mana.html
7771,Mana,Introduction,"Mana capacity can be increased further through the use of variousarmorssuch as Gem Robes andNebula armor, plusaccessories.Reforgingaccessories to theArcanemodifier can further boost maximum mana.",paragraph,Mana.html

7773,Mana,Boost gear[],"To use magic weapons more often, certain items can increase the maximum mana or reduce the cost of using magic weapons. Because of how mana regeneration works, these can also effectively increase the rate of mana regeneration, so long as the player takes care to remain above certain current mana thresholds.",paragraph,Mana.html
7774,Mana,Restoring Mana[],Mana regenerates on its own when not in use until the player's current maximum is reached.,paragraph,Mana.html
7775,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"The natural rate of regeneration is modified by whether or not the player is moving and how much current mana a character has. This formula exists to punish reckless mana use – if all mana is spent, the player will havealmost no regeneration at alluntil they stop moving or use a potion. Conversely, when the player stands still waiting between uses of magical weapons until mana is refilled, mana recovers at its fastest possible rate. Wearing items that increase the maximum mana can thus also increase the rate of recovery, as each use of magic will still leave the player with more remaining mana, and the higher multiplier.",paragraph,Mana.html
7776,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"However, mana does not regenerate for a small period after any magic is expended, meaning that to start regenerating mana the player must stop casting spells for a short time. The regeneration cooldown starts the moment the player stops spending mana, so castingMagic MissileandFlamelashwill start the cooldown as soon as it is cast, regardless of how long the projectile is held. Setting upStar Statuesontimerscan help giving magic-using players much better rates of magical fire inboss-fighting or enemy-farming situations where there is time to prepare where the player is going to fight. (ACrystal Ballis also helpful in such situations.)",paragraph,Mana.html
7777,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"To be more specific,[1]the mana regeneration has a similar mechanism of health regeneration – there is also a mana counter which is increased by a mana regeneration rate every tick.[2]When it reaches 120 or more, it would be reduced by 120 and increase mana by 1. (So, 1 mana regeneration rate equals to 0.5 mana per second.)",paragraph,Mana.html

7779,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"It will be reduced by 1 (if moving) or 2 (if standing still) every tick (also an additional 1 per tick if wearing theMana Regeneration Band). Once it reaches 0, the mana regeneration rate would be calculated by the formula below:",paragraph,Mana.html

7781,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"Then, if the player has theMana Regenerationbuff, the mana regeneration delay will be reset to 20 if it is greater than 20, and it would always treat the player as standing still and having maximum mana. So, it would act like this formula:",paragraph,Mana.html
7782,Mana,Restoring Mana[],"If a player wants to rely on magical weapons for normal exploration, they should memorize how to best recover mana, even while distracted. To make the most of mana regeneration, the player should practice understanding the timing between when they fire, and when the tone that indicates they have recovered full mana occurs, (so that they fire their next attack at exactly that moment,) and try to remain stationary during times when the mana recovery starts. Firing can be practiced in a safe location like the player'shomeuntil they are comfortable with how they regenerate their mana.",paragraph,Mana.html

7784,Mana,Notes[],Mana-restoring effects will not exceed the player's maximum mana and any mana restoration beyond the maximum is lost. It is thus advisable to take care when pressing the mana potion hotkey to avoid wasteful overuse of mana restoring items.,list,Mana.html

Three exceptions are the Slime Staff, Finch Staff, and theFlinx Staff, as damage rounding causes the bonus provided by Ruthless and Mythical to be equal.Weapon speed is not very useful for minion or sentry-summoning weapons, as it will only decrease the time it takes to summon a minion.

Previously, only one of those could ever be visible at a time (for instance, if you had visible wings, you could not ever see a cape, backpack, or tail).Combat Wrench now displays on the player regardless of what other backpacks are currently shown (it is its own category of back-draw)Angel Halo now functions like Unicorn Horn, in that it will be visible regardless of any other head equipment or vanity that is equippedAccessories which draw on the head have also been split into several subgroups, which will allow several of them to be worn simultaneously.

Due to the shape of the Skull not fitting standard ""Terrarian face"" shapes, on certain helmets, it will use a different sprite with a more standard layout. You can also wear virtually all physically compatible Head/Face accessories with the Obsidian Skull as well.Ginger Beard has been resprited, and if set to visible, is now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face. It is also now compatible with most other Head/Face accessories.Reworked Shield/Cape display so that Shields and Capes are now visually compatible with each other again. The Shield now draws ""in front"" of the Cape, instead of underneath it, which led to many of the initial issues.Shields which are set to not be visible can still be dyed, and will show that dye when actively used (such as Shield of Cthulhu dash or Brand of the Inferno Block). Previously, if they were set to invisible, their active use version would never have dye.Long-player hair is now properly compatible with wings/backpacks, and will show the full length of the hair without being cut-off visuallyThe special trails left by various types of running boots (Sailfish Boots, Flurry Boots, Flower Boots, etc) are now also subject to vanity usage, and you can use the one you prefer either through re-ordering accessories or using the social slotsBone Glove now has visual vanity for the hand slotBalance ChangesBalancing changes have been introduced, in line with the PC version.

This matches the default from Mobile 1.3 release.Single Tap Up - Single Tap up on the left stick to trigger a jump/fly action. A perfect middle ground between the old and the new.Swipe up (Legacy) - Any upward movement on the left stick triggers a jump/fly action. This matches the default from Mobile 1.2.Disabled - There is no means to trigger a jump/fly action from the left stick. For those that prefer the Jump Button.In order to make room for the Jump Options in the Settings Menu ""Tutorials On/Off"" setting has been moved to Interface.Added an option to enable Auto-Swing for most weaponsThis is off by default, in order to keep with the intended core design of the game - where Auto-Swing is a weapon property tied to specific weapons.This is located in Settings ---> Cursor.Be aware a small selection of items have been excluded to avoid potential significant disruptions in gameplay (ex. Rope coils, thrown flails, magic mirror, etc.).

9597,Modifier,Contents,"Amodifier, also known as aprefix(although in some languages it becomes a suffix), applies permanent changes to an item's statistics. It changes the name of an item by adding a prefix to the item's name (displayed when selected in thehotbarand in itstooltip), such as ""Adept"", ""Godly"", or ""Broken"" (e.g. ""DemonicMinishark""). A complete list of all eighty-three (83) modifiers can be foundbelow. Hovering the cursor over an item with a modifier in aninventoryslot will show the modification details beneath the item's description.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9598,Modifier,Contents,"Accessorymodifiers will grant a bonus to one of the player's stats, such asdefense,movement speed, or maximummana. The modifier is applied as long as the accessory is equipped. Certain accessory-like items that cannot be placed in an accessory slot (e.g., aCell Phone), cannot receive modifiers.",list,Modifier.html
9599,Modifier,Contents,"Weaponmodifiers alter the statistics of that particular weapon, and can affect up to five statistics. The effects of a given modifier can be all positive, all negative, or mixed.Toolsthat damageenemies, such aspickaxesandhammers, may also have these modifiers. Weapon-like items that do not inflict damage (e.g., aBug Net) cannot gain modifiers; neither can consumable weapons (e.g.,Shurikens).",list,Modifier.html
9600,Modifier,Contents,Most but not all weapons and accessories will receive a modifier upon the item's creation. Modifiers can be added or changed afterwards by theGoblin Tinkerer'sReforgefunction.,paragraph,Modifier.html
9601,Modifier,Initial modifiers[],"Nearly all weapons and accessories have up to a 75%[1]chance of receiving a random modifier upon the item's creation: Naturally generated in aChest,crafted, looted from agrab bag(excludingPresents), or dropped by a slainenemy. Items produced byfishing(e.g.,RockfishorBalloon Pufferfish), opening Presents (e.g.,Candy Cane Sword), and completingAnglerquests (e.g.,Angler Earring) never get initial modifiers, though they can be reforged to gain a modifier.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9602,Modifier,Initial modifiers[],"Items purchased from NPCs never have any modifiers, due to the ability to refund items (selling them back for full price before closing the menu) introduced in1.4.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9603,Modifier,Initial modifiers[],"No modifiers are visible on an NPC's shop stock, but one can be supplied when the item is bought (its purchase price will be unaffected). However, an item that a player sells to an NPC will keep its modifier, and if repurchased in the same trading session, the modifier will be unchanged.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9604,Modifier,Initial modifiers[],"For a weapon's initial modifier, there is a ""mercy"" mechanic that reduces the chance of penalties:[1]If a weapon's initial modifier is one of a list of ""bad"" modifiers, it has a66.67*2/3 (66.67%)chance of being voided, and the item will be created without a modifier. This can sharply reduce the chance of having a modifier at all, but does so by eliminating only bad modifiers. The modifiers considered ""bad"" for this purpose are: Tiny, Terrible, Small, Dull, Unhappy, Awful, Lethargic, Awkward, Inept, Ignorant, Deranged, Broken, Damaged, Weak, Shoddy, Slow, Sluggish, and Lazy. Note that some usually-unwanted modifiers arenotincluded in this ""mercy"" list:  Shameful, Intense, Annoying, and Frenzying.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9605,Modifier,Initial modifiers[],"Accessories do not have any ""bad"" modifiers regardless, only lesser bonuses.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9606,Modifier,Reforging[],"Reforging is a service provided by theGoblin Tinkerer, which applies a new, random modifier to an item in exchange forcoins. It will add a modifier to an unmodified item or replace an existing modifier. It will never leave an item without a modifier. All eligible modifiers have equal chances, without the ""mercy"" filtering of initial modifiers.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9607,Modifier,Reforging[],"The Goblin Tinkerer charges one third of the item's current buyvalue, which is166.67*5/3 (166.67%)of its sell price or33.33*1/3 (33.33%)of its base value. TheDiscount Cardor its upgrade, theGreedy Ring, can be used to lower reforge costs by 20%. Existing modifiers affect an item's value, so items with poor modifiers are cheaper to reforge, while reforging an already well-modified item will be more expensive.The price is adjusted according to the Goblin Tinkerer's currenthappiness.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9608,Modifier,Reforging[],"Reforging can be accessed by talking to the Goblin Tinkerer and choosing ""Reforge"" from the options, then placing the item to be reforged in the box that appears below the inventory. Below the listed cost is a small gray hammerthat, when clicked, reforges the item for the listed price.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9609,Modifier,Reforging[],"In theOld-gen console versionandMobile version, items are reforged by clicking the reforge button after speaking to the Goblin Tinkerer. It will pull up the inventory and highlight items that can be reforged (ones that cannot are hidden by a shadow). Hover the cursor over the item that is to be reforged and press the reforge button.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9610,Modifier,Notes[],"Modifiers can raise or lower therarityof an item by up to two tiers. They can also raise itsvalueby up to 210% (to more than three times the original value), or lower it by up to 67% (to one third of the original value).",list,Modifier.html
9611,Modifier,Notes[],"The percentages displayed via in-gametooltipsmay vary depending on the item's base values, since those percentages are determined after rounding. For example, the Murderous modifier on aHandgunwill display a 6% damage increase, while on aMagic Missileit will display a 7% increase.",list,Modifier.html
9612,Modifier,Notes[],The modifiers of items used in crafting have no effect on the crafted item. Any modifier given to the newly crafted item will be completely random.,list,Modifier.html
9613,Modifier,Notes[],"A weapon cannot get a modifier that affects a stat it does not have. For instance, only ranged weapons can have their velocity modified and only magic and summoning weapons can have their mana cost modified.Furthermore, a weapon can only get a modifier if all of its changes have an effect on the weapon after rounding. For example, weapons that deal noknockbackcannot receive modifiers that affect knockback, and magic weapons with very low mana costs cannot receive modifiers that affect mana cost.",list,Modifier.html
9614,Modifier,Notes[],"Furthermore, a weapon can only get a modifier if all of its changes have an effect on the weapon after rounding. For example, weapons that deal noknockbackcannot receive modifiers that affect knockback, and magic weapons with very low mana costs cannot receive modifiers that affect mana cost.",list,Modifier.html
9615,Modifier,Notes[],"There are two modifiers with the same name – ""Deadly"" – but they have different effects depending on the weapon type. One is a common weapons modifier providing +10% damage and speed. The other is a ranged weapons modifier providing +10% damage, +2% critical strike chance, and +5% speed, velocity and knockback.",list,Modifier.html
9616,Modifier,Notes[],"There are two universal modifiers with the same effects but with different names, Forceful and Strong.",list,Modifier.html
9617,Modifier,Accessory modifiers[],"Accessorymodifiers are only active while the accessory is equipped in a non-vanity slot. Nearly every accessory item can be reforged, with the exceptions of theGuide Voodoo Doll,Clothier Voodoo Doll, and all theMusic Boxes. Unlikeweapons, accessories can only receive beneficial modifiers. Modifiers cannot be legitimately obtained onarmor. Accessories can have one of the following nineteen modifiers attached to them:",paragraph,Modifier.html
9618,Modifier,Accessory modifiers[],"The average value boost for all accessory modifiers is +27.75%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +20.81%.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9619,Modifier,Weapon modifiers[],"These modifiers only apply when the weapon is being used. Weapons and tools that have no knockback cannot get modifiers that change knockback; examples includedrills, theMagical Harp, and manyguns(such as theMinishark).",paragraph,Modifier.html
9620,Modifier,Weapon modifiers[],The stackable weaponsLight DiscandBananarangcannot have modifiers.,paragraph,Modifier.html
9621,Modifier,Universal[],"Flails,spears,yoyos,boomerangs,chainsaws,drills(including theDrax) and theChlorophyte Jackhammercan only have universal modifiers, because they cannot have their speed modified.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9622,Modifier,Universal[],"Universal modifiers can also be found on all other weapon types. The best universal modifier is Godly or Demonic. The two modifiers only differ in knockback, a stat that is not considered very useful (or even beneficial) in many situations. The difference in knockback is also negligible enough that Godly and Demonic can be treated as the same modifier.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9623,Modifier,Universal[],"Among drills, only theAdamantite Drill,Chlorophyte Drill,Cobalt Drill,Drax,Laser Drill,Mythril Drill,Nebula Drill,Orichalcum Drill,Palladium Drill,Solar Flare Drill,Stardust Drill,Titanium Drill, andVortex Drillcan obtain the Godly modifier, since only these drills have knockback. The best damage-increasing modifier for other drills is Demonic, although it is unlikely that a drill would be of much use in combat.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9624,Modifier,Universal[],Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.,paragraph,Modifier.html
9625,Modifier,Universal[],"The average value boost for a random Universal modifier is +17.12%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +12.84%.",paragraph,Modifier.html

9628,Modifier,Melee[],"Almost allmelee weaponsthat are swung overhead (swords,pickaxes,hammers,axes, andhamaxes) along withshortswordsandwhipscan be reforged with these modifiers, in addition to common and universal modifiers. With the exception of shortswords (includingStarlight), all melee weapons that are not swung upon use (such asspears,flails, andyoyos) cannot receive these modifiers. TheCopper AxeandWooden Hammercan receive any of these modifiers except for those that affect damage.

9639,Modifier,Tips[],"It is straightforward (but sometimes expensive) to force a given modifier, by reforging the item until it receives the desired modifier. Note that reforging has no ""memory"": Upon each reforge, there is an equal chance of getting any of the modifiers possible for that item, including the modifier it currently has. A casual guess at ""how many tries will it take"" is likely to be misleading, because statistics are tricky: In practice, it is better to consider that at any given moment, there is a 50% chance of getting any specific modifier in a given number of tries:",paragraph,Modifier.html

9644,Modifier,Tips[],twenty-eight tries for weapons with melee modifiers (forty total),list,Modifier.html
9645,Modifier,Tips[],"Being willing to accept more than one modifier will speed things up sharply. For example, if the player accepts either a Lucky or Menacing modifier for boosting their offense, it will take half as much time to reforge compared to reforging the accessory to Menacing specifically. Similarly, if any of three modifiers for a melee weapon will do, there is a 50% chance of getting one of them in only ten tries. Weapon modifiers that are widely considered ""good enough"" include Godly, Demonic, Ruthless, Deadly, and Masterful.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9646,Modifier,Tips[],"This all applies regardless of how many tries have been made before. The above numbers make no account of modifiers forbidden for individual weapons, but that will just make the process faster.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9647,Modifier,Tips[],"It is technically possible to make a profit when reforging a weapon once from a bad modifier to a good one, but reforging will normally result in an average monetary loss.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9648,Modifier,Tips[],"When autopause is enabled, the name of the reforge will not show up above the player's head until the game is unpaused. However, one can get a sense of the modifier's value by looking at the reforge cost, potentially speeding up the process. It is a good idea to check the modifier only when the reforge cost is expensive enough to indicate a potentially good modifier.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9649,Modifier,Tips[],"For example, anAvenger Emblemwill normally cost1440to reforge if it is Menacing, Lucky, Quick, Violent, or Warding. If aiming for one of those modifiers, one can immediately skip any reforges of lesser value and only check when the displayed cost is1440(remember to account for goblin happiness and discounts).",paragraph,Modifier.html
9650,Modifier,Tips[],"Similarly, if reforging a sword to Legendary, it is a good idea to make a mental note of how much the weapon costs to reforge when it is Godly/Superior/Demonic, and only stop reforging once the cost exceeds that amount.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9651,Modifier,Weapons[],"Due to various limitations with certain weapon classes, determining the best possible modifiers may not be as simple as comparing statistics, and players can waste money trying to acquire modifiers that are impossible to achieve for their given weapon. The following is an easy rundown of the most desirable possible modifiers for each weapon or weapon type in most situations:",paragraph,Modifier.html
9652,Modifier,Weapons[],"The best overall melee modifier is Legendary, which is only applicable to broadswords andshortswords. The best modifier for all other melee weapons (such asspears,flails,yoyos, and unique melee weapons like theScourge of the Corruptor) is Godly or Demonic. TheTerrariancan obtain a special version of the Legendary modifier unique to it.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9653,Modifier,Weapons[],"The best overall ranged modifier is Unreal. The best modifier for ranged weapons with no base knockback (such as theMinisharkor low-tierbows) is Demonic or Deadly. Although theHarpoonis classified as a ranged weapon, it cannot receive the Unreal modifier; its best modifier is Godly. TheChain Gunfires so quickly that it cannot receive any modifier that increases its speed by 10% or less. As such, its best modifier is Rapid, with Godly and Demonic as more ammo-efficient alternatives.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9654,Modifier,Weapons[],"The best overall magic modifier is Mythical. The best modifier for magic weapons that are unable to inflict knockback (such as theNimbus RodorLast Prism) is Demonic. If the player bears low maximum mana, Masterful may be preferred over Mythical, or Mystic over Demonic. Some magic weapons, such as theClinger Staff,Magnet Sphere, andRainbow Gun, create a long-lasting projectile that remains active after switching weapons. The critical strike chance of these weapons is calculated based on the magic weapon currently being held, meaning that base damage is the only stat that matters, and therefore their best modifier is Ruthless.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9655,Modifier,Weapons[],"The best overall summon modifier is Ruthless. The reduced mana cost, increased speed, critical strike chance, and knockback provided by Mythical are less useful: Summon weapons use mana only for the initial summoning, minions cannot deal critical hits, and their knockback is negligible even with modifiers. The Ruthless modifier offers the most effective minion boost, by increasing the minion's damage per hit the most. The best modifier for whips is Legendary.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9656,Modifier,Weapons[],"For the purposes of mining and resource collection, the best modifier for tools such as pickaxes, hammers, and axes is Light. Note that for many tools the Legendary modifier gives the same tool speed increase as Light due to tool speed being rounded down to the next whole number. The Legendary modifier is superior in these cases as it also provides increased damage, critical strike chance, size, and knockback over the Light modifier, though the impact is relatively low given that mining tools are rarely used for combat.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9657,Modifier,Weapons[],"If theLucky Coinor any of its upgrades is equipped, it is desirable to hit enemies as often as possible, dealing as little damage as possible, in order to maximize the income. The following modifiers reduce the weapon damage the most, yielding more coins per enemy:",paragraph,Modifier.html
9658,Modifier,Accessories[],"Menacing, Lucky, and Warding are generally agreed to be the most consistently useful accessory modifiers.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9659,Modifier,Accessories[],"Quick and Violent can be useful in the early game, but become less so as the player gains access to faster weapons and movement options.",list,Modifier.html
9660,Modifier,Accessories[],"Similarly, Arcane helps only with magical weapons. It gives an advantage for early players with low maximum mana, but more powerful magic weapons can drain even a maxed-out player's mana quickly, making mana recovery more important than a fractional increase to the maximum.",list,Modifier.html
9661,Modifier,Accessories[],"The value of damage and critical chance vs. defense can be difficult to measure. The former directly causes fights to end sooner, while the latter causes players to die slower or potentially even reach a winning state where they regenerate more health than they lose. Because defense directly subtracts from incoming damage, each point of defense becomes more powerful in proportion to the defense a player already has. Stacking defense with multiple Warding accessories can be helpful for new players who get hit often, as well as for veterans who want to use powerful close-ranged weapons. However, if one's defense is not high enough to reduce incoming damage to 50 /75/100damage, each additional point of defense is less valuable than 1% damage or critical strike chance.",paragraph,Modifier.html
9662,Modifier,Accessories[],"The choice between Menacing (damage) and Lucky (critical chance) has long been the subject of extensive debate among the player base. Generally speaking, balancing Menacing and Lucky (favoring Menacing) gives slightly higher DPS over a range of opponents:",paragraph,Modifier.html
9663,Modifier,Accessories[],"The Menacing and Lucky modifiers each simply add their bonuses if there are more than one of the same, but their effects multiply with each other.If a player has five Menacing accessories, their DPS will be 1.2 * 1.04 (base crit chance) * 100 = 24.8% above ""normal"".If they have five Lucky accessories, their DPS will average 24% above ""normal"" (4% base+20%, and the double-damage critical hits get averaged with the others).With three Menacing and two Lucky accessories, their DPS would be 1.12 * 1.12 * 100 = 25.44% above ""normal"".",list,Modifier.html

9667,Modifier,Accessories[],"However, the above logic does not account for enemy defense:Against moderate defense (compared to the weapon in use), damage bonuses are proportionately more powerful, because they increase the margin of damage for every hit.Against very high defense or with low-damage weapons (that is, even the enhanced damage cannot penetrate), increasing the critical chance becomes the only way to increase damage dealt. The extreme for this case is the Dungeon Guardian, where all hits do 1 damage except critical hits, which do 2.",list,Modifier.html

9721,Moon Lord,Attacks,"The hand eyes also spawn multiplePhantasmal Eyes, which move in all directions for a short while before homing in on the player. Like the Phantasmal Spheres, they cannot travel at an upward angle, so they can be evaded by swerving upwards. If they cannot get a direct lock and a player is in range then they will attempt to match the target's trajectory to stay in their path. They explode upon contact with a block or player.",list,Moon_Lord.html
9722,Moon Lord,Attacks,"The hand eyes also occasionally fire twoPhantasmal Boltsin quick succession, aiming at the player, which pass through blocks, requiring swerves to avoid. Another viable option is to quickly drop down before the bolts fire, saving the player from getting hit.",list,Moon_Lord.html
9723,Moon Lord,Attacks,"When attached to the Moon Lord's head, the head eye opens every 20–21 seconds for a few seconds, and then fires aPhantasmal Deathray: a large laser that sweeps 60 degrees upward over the player. This is by far Moon Lord's most damaging attack. It may almost take half of a player’s HP, making it much harder to survive the proceeding attacks. Afterward, the head eye blinks a couple times, and fires twoPhantasmal Bolts(similarly to those of the hands), and then closes.As of 1.4, the Head eye will also fire twoPhantasmal Boltsbefore performing the Deathray attack, the Deathray can pass through solid blocks as well. In thegetfixedboi seed, after the Phantasmal Deathray begins, the Moon Lord will eject around 5Moon Boulders, which bounce about very quickly and over long distances and inflict massive damage upon touching the player.

9761,Moon Lord,Tips,"Dodging the Moon Lord's attacks is crucial. In particular, thePhantasmal Deathrayshould be avoided at all costs.Useful items that increase the player's mobility includeGravitation Potions, fast wings like theFishronorEmpress Wings, items allowing to dash (e.g. theTabi), theSoaring Insignia, and numerousmount-summoning items like theGelatinous Pillion,Shrimpy Truffle,Cosmic Car Key, orWitch's Broom. The player might also consider constructing askybridgemade out ofAsphalt BlocksorMinecart Tracks(especially if using theMechanical Cart).Hiding under a row of blocks while using a weapon that can attack through blocks, such as theSolar Eruption, can nullify the Moon Lord's Phantasmal Deathray. Two rows of blocks can be quite effective. The player should make sure that the barrier has horizontal running room, in order to make space to dodge the Phantasmal Spheres.Using homing weapons orammolikeChlorophyte Bulletsallow the player to focus on dodging.If neither high mobility nor barriers are available, theRod of Discordallows the player to easily teleport behind the sweeping motion of the Phantasmal Deathray.If none of these items are available, equipping accessories that allow dodging such as theTabimay be crucial.",list,Moon_Lord.html

9771,Moon Lord,Tips,"It is advisable to kill the eye on the head first. It is the only eye capable of firing the Phantasmal Deathray and remains closed for significantly longer than the eyes in the hands.

They travel toward it at a variable rate, remaining completely stationary (or at least apparently so) if the Moon Lord is in his default position behind the player. As a result of this, though it may seem counterintuitive, it is actually beneficial to be closer to the mouth to destroy Moon Leech Clots, as they will not move away as quickly.",list,Moon_Lord.html

9777,Moon Lord,Tips,"The entire fight can be trivialised inExpert Modevia the use of theMechanical Cart. Setting up a minecart track across the sky with bumpers at both end will force Moon Lord to constantly teleport to the player, and allow them to avoid nearly every attack. UsingBeetle armorand theVortex BeaterwithChlorophyte Bulletswill allow the player to shoot at the reeling Moon Lord, while keeping them relatively safe.",list,Moon_Lord.html

9782,Moon Lord,Trivia,"– According to theofficial game lore, though it was initially theorized (and joked by staff) that the Moon Lord was Cthulhu's brother, it appears that he is Cthulhu itself, or at least is what it implies. This entity was detrimental to existence and was finally banished by the Dryads, an ancient race of who the Dryad NPC is the only survivor, after they ripped out his organs and exiled him to the moon. It further appears that the Celestial Events and eventual battle are his final attempt at total conquest, as stated directly.In the same post where the developers, namely Arkhayla, joked that the Moon Lord was Cthulhu's brother. They also said his name was Steve. However, this has been confirmed to not be true.",list,Moon_Lord.html

There is a ""Happiness"" option in every NPCs dialogue window, that makes the NPC tell the player if any factors make them currently happy or unhappy, although they often try to put a positive spin on things and will not say what could make them happier or unhappier.

Conversely, NPC unhappiness will raise prices for goods purchased from them, up to a maximum of150*3/2 (150%), and decrease the value of goods sold to them, down to a minimum67*2/3 (67%)(rounded to the nearest 1%). When an NPC that sells items, other than the Skeleton Merchant or Traveling Merchant, has a price modifier at or below 90%, they will allow the player to purchase thepylonfor their current biome. TheTax Collector's current tax funds and tax collection limit are both divided by his happiness factor, such that at maximum happiness he will store up to133333, and at maximum unhappiness he will only store up to66666; the amount of taxes that he collects per minute also scales at the same rate.[7][8]",paragraph,NPCs.html

In addition, there are nine more Plantera's Tentacles, attached to Plantera's Hooks in groups of three. Furthermore, the eight tentacles that are attached to Plantera's body can respawn after they have been killed (this does not apply to the tentacles on the hooks). The rate is randomized, but it depends on the number of tentacles that are alive – if all are dead, a new tentacle will be spawned after 5 seconds, on average. This is increased by 5 seconds per living tentacle, hence it takes an average of 180 seconds for all eight tentacles to fully respawn. A single defeated tentacle will take 40 seconds to respawn, on average, assuming the other seven tentacles remain alive for the duration.[1]",paragraph,Plantera.html

These statues can bewiredand activated to spawnenemies, drop items, or teleport a randomNPCto their location. Statue-spawned enemies do not dropcoins. Before the 1.4 update they generally would drop their other usual items at a reduced rate, with the exception of theMimic, which does not drop any items whatsoever other than itsbanner, obtained after the designated amount of kills. Since the 1.4 update, this is only the case with certain statues. Aside from normal items, Slimes, Crabs, and Wall Creepers spawned from statues may also drop hearts and mana stars, potentially granting an alternative source of health and mana. Since the effects of the Life Drain and Vampire Knives work on spawned enemies, the player can build a pit with any timer spawning weak enemies to recover health during a boss fight.

Three exceptions are the Slime Staff, Finch Staff, and theFlinx Staff, as damage rounding causes the bonus provided by Ruthless and Mythical to be equal.Weapon speed is not very useful for minion or sentry-summoning weapons, as it will only decrease the time it takes to summon a minion.

Both contain similar hazards and feature their own uniqueenemies,items, andblocks. Thetools,weapons, andarmorobtained via Corruption materials are generally faster, but slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials. Corruption enemies tend to have slightly lower stats, such as health, defense, and damage. Water here is also purple.",paragraph,The_Corruption.html

Both contain similar hazards and feature their own uniqueenemies,items, andblocks.

Break atleast 1 block under you, and use theShadowflame Knifedownwards to continuously chip at The Destroyers Health while taking minimal damage.The main counter to this strategy are The Destroyer's Probes. A way to easily deal with them is to use the fullTitanium Armorset, as the Titanium Shield can easily destroy The Probes if they get close. If the world doesnt have any Titanium, theNimbus Rodcan be used as a substitute, killing The Probes aswell as dealing some extra damage to The Destroyer itself.Good items to use during in this strategy also include theNimbus Rod/Crimson rod,Shadowflame Hex Doll(when The Destroyer is near the player),Daedalus Stormbow,Super Star Shooter,Inferno Potion, and other AOE / Pierce items.The solid blocks that the player is incased in, will prevent The Destroyer and it's Probes to damage the Player with Lasers (except for rarely a laser going through the small hole at the bottom)This strategy is NOT completely foolproof, as The Destroyer might randomly lunge higher than normal and go through the box, dealing massive damage if hit from the head, aswell as bonus damage from its body, which (unless the box is wide enough to dodge) might Kill the player, and assuming the player doesn't die, The Destroyer can shoot its lasers at The Player, if its deep enough in the box.keeping the box about 3 blocks tall will effectively prevent this issue",list,The_Destroyer.html

It is a large, open cavern that stretches across the bottom of the world, with a ceiling ofAsh Blocksand a lower terrain of largeLavapools,Ash Blocks, andHellstone. It also contains numerousRuined Houses, which are natural structures containing uniquefurnitureand loot. TheWall of Fleshbosscan be summoned in the Underworld; defeating it will cause the world to convert toHardmode.",paragraph,The_Underworld.html
14534,The Underworld,Introduction,"The Underworld contains many hazards, such as large pools ofLavaand various difficultenemies.Hellstone, a valuable crafting material only obtainable in the Underworld, inflicts theBurningdebuffwhen touched and releases half a tile ofLavawhen mined. Further, because the Wall of Flesh is summoned by dropping aGuide Voodoo Dollinto Lava, killing aVoodoo Demonpositioned over Lava can inadvertently summon it.",paragraph,The_Underworld.html
14535,The Underworld,Introduction,"The middle two-quarters of the Underworld contains severalRuined Houses, which are towers made fromObsidian Bricksand, less commonly,Hellstone Bricksthat containShadow Chests,Hellforges,Pots,Obsidian furniture, and other lootable items.

14542,The Underworld,Notes[],"If anyWaterenters the Underworld, it will quickly evaporate. Therefore, attempting to generateObsidianhere is usually not very effective, due to most of the Water evaporating before touching any lava. However, aWater Bucketcan still be used to quench somewhat smaller amounts of Lava.",list,The_Underworld.html

14545,The Underworld,Notes[],"OnOld-gen console version, the lava flowing through the cracks of the walls won't appear if a player uses any weapon that produces light on its own but if the weapon used is a sword that is able to shoot a beam like theFrostbrand, the beam will make the lava appear in the cracks.",list,The_Underworld.html

14552,The Underworld,Tips[],"Minionsare a very effective way to counterFire ImpsandRed Devils. AnImp Staffis the best choice pre-Hardmode. Be careful not to let the minions kill anyVoodoo Demonsabove lava pools, as a dropped Guide Voodoo Doll touching Lava causes theGuideto die and theWall of Fleshto spawn.",list,The_Underworld.html
14553,The Underworld,Tips[],"Since the Underworld spans the entire length of the world, it is easy to locate theUnderground Jungle,Corruption/Crimson, andHallowbiomes. The bottoms of these biomes are often seen at the roof of the Underworld.",list,The_Underworld.html
14554,The Underworld,Tips[],"Despite the sequential boss difficulty, it is much easier to survive in the Underworld than in theDungeonor Underground Jungle due to the much slowerspawn rate. In contrast to those biomes, the Underworld can be explored fairly safely. When startingHardmode, the Underworld is one of the safest areas of the world because there are no new or more difficult enemies spawning there until defeating amechanical bosscausesLava BatsandRed Devilsto spawn.",list,The_Underworld.html
14555,The Underworld,Tips[],"One way to avoid most of the Underworld spawns (exceptFire ImpsandBone Serpents) is to stay in confined quarters while miningHellstone. Ruined Houses are usually a safe base to tunnel to Hellstone veins from. With care, a player can tunnel directly from shelter through the ash, leaving spaces for Lava to drain away from the player as they mine.Obsidian PlatformsandWater Bucketswill be helpful for this method.",list,The_Underworld.html
14556,The Underworld,Tips[],"The Ruined Houses are large enough to allow some enemies to spawn inside, but replacing theirbackground wallswill prevent that. Tunnels and bunkers will also help.",list,The_Underworld.html
14557,The Underworld,Tips[],"It is beneficial to seal all lava pools, because that prevents both inadvertent Wall of Flesh summonings and accidentally falling into a pool. Furthermore, it serves as terrain preparation for the Wall of Flesh fight.",list,The_Underworld.html
14558,The Underworld,Tips[],"Avoid usingStone Blocksfor bunkers or bridges, because the smashing ofAltarsmay convert one or more Stone Blocks intoEbonstone/CrimstoneorPearlstone. While these biomes do not usually appear in the Underworld and cannot infect the usual blocks there, introduced stone bridges or shelters can spread the contagious biome following the block conversion. If enough stone blocks were placed, it might convert enough of them to produce spawns from that biome. These stone blocks may also be difficult to find when trying to purify the world completely. By contrast, the native Ash Blocks are incorruptible and are suitable for bridges, or in any case, processedStone Slabsfrom theHeavy Work Benchor using any sort ofWoodorbrickwill avoid all problems frombiome spreading.",list,The_Underworld.html
14559,The Underworld,Tips[],"The native Underworld spawns can be overridden by placing at least 75 blocks ofMeteorite, effectively creating anartificial Meteorite biome.",list,The_Underworld.html
14560,The Underworld,Tips[],"It is possible to flood parts of the Underworld by digging channels to dump anoceanover the Lava. The water will eventually evaporate, but not before it converts the lava surface to Obsidian, sealing off many lava pools.",list,The_Underworld.html

14618,Traveling Merchant,Items sold[],"Due to elaborate randomizer functions and dependencies upon several variables, it is nearly impossible to state an exact chance of an item being sold by the Traveling Merchant.[3]However, it is possible to group them in six rarity ""slots"", ranging from ""Common"" to ""Extraordinarily Rare"". Note that these slots do not correspond to the Traveling Merchant's shop inventory slots – all sold items may be from only one slot. They are only meant to provide a rough, comparative estimate of an item's rarity. Each shop slot will roll a 1/n chance of being for every possible item where n is 100 × the rarity slot. This chance is affected by the luckiest player currently in the world. Items that are always selected when another item is selected don't have their own chance being selected. All colored team blocks share the same chance of getting selected; if the chance succeeds, the color is randomly chosen. When multiple items pass this chance, the item that was tested, the latest will be the selected.",paragraph,Traveling_Merchant.html
14619,Traveling Merchant,Items sold[],"Within the slots, items higher in the list below have a marginally higher chance of being sold, e.g., theCompanion Cubeis sold slightly more often than theWater Gun(on average), because it is higher in the list.",paragraph,Traveling_Merchant.html

15042,Walls,Introduction,"Unsafe wallsare a type of wall that appears during world generation, and can generally not be utilized by the player; when broken, they will either drop their safe equivalent or nothing at all. Unsafe walls will not stop enemies from spawning, and cannot be utilized for houses. They also have a quirk in that they must be removed by starting from their edge (i.e., adjacent space with no wall), which for explosives means that an edge must exist somewhere within the radius of the explosion.",list,Walls.html
15043,Walls,Introduction,"Distinguishing safe walls from unsafe walls can be tricky because many walls, such asObsidian Brick WallsorDungeon Brick Walls, exist in both safe and unsafe forms. With these walls (both of which are harvestable), the player must break the unsafe walls and replace them in order for them to count as safe walls. Similarly, many (or all, on) naturally-generated walls have safe counterparts which are obtainable through crafting or purchase from NPCs.",paragraph,Walls.html
