3DS_version,"Inventory interface in the 3DS version
The3DS versionofTerrariawas published by505 Gamesand developed byCodeglue. It is a port of CodeGlue'sMobile version. This version contains exclusive content not available on other versions, includingenemies,armor,weapons,pets, andbosses, but some exclusive content is also available on theOld-gen console versionandWindows Phone version.
The 3DS version is unlike the other console versions, not only because of its exclusive entities, but also because it follows its own update line. A list of all the updates it has had, as well as a few highlights of each one, can be found at3DS version history.
It can be played on theNew Nintendo 3DSfamily of systems with a higher frame rate, an expanded world option, and the ability to move the camera around using the C Stick, similar to the effect ofBinoculars.
The 3DS version's most recent update is equal toPC1.2.1, with some content from1.2.2to1.3.1. It will not receive any significant updates past this 1.2.1 equivalent.[1]
Purchasing the 3DS version:
With the exception of theZapinator, all of the following content is also available on theWindows Phone(the content was removed from the currentMobile versionin the1.3 update). Some of the content is available on theOld-gen console versionas well.
The Nintendo3DSversion ofTerrariais largely equivalent toPC version1.2.1. However, some content from future versions has been added into the game, mostly from1.2.2to1.3.1. Below is a list of said content."

Accessories,"Most accessories must be placed in their accessory equip slots, seen at the bottom right of the image, for their effects to apply.
Accessories (aka equipable items)are equipable items that can providestatboosts and/or special abilities such as limited flight. Accessories must be placed in a character's equip accessory slots to work, with the exception of someinformational accessorieswhich work simply by being in a character's inventory.
InJourneyand Normal mode worlds it is possible to benefit from five accessories simultaneously (given there are no override effects - for example, it is not possible to wear more than one pair ofwingsat the same time). InExpert Modea sixth slot is obtainable by consuming aDemon Heart. Ultimately,Master Modeincludes a sixth slot by default which, when combined with a Demon Heart, provides seven slots. Neither the Demon Heart slot nor the Master Mode slot is functional in Normal mode worlds, and both will only function when the difficulty is set to the corresponding level in Journey Mode worlds.
No duplicate accessories may be equipped, but theTinkerer's Workshopcan combine many accessories together into new accessories with multiple effects. For example,Hermes Boots(or another similar accessory) andRocket Bootscan be crafted intoSpectre Boots.
Each accessory slot also has a respectivevanityslot (as well as adyeslot) which allows a character to equip twice the amount of accessories for cosmetic or storage purposes. Accessories can be set to be invisible on the wearer but still provide their buffs. Additionally, with the 1.4.4 Labor of Love update, characters can have 3 different loadouts, each with their own unique Accessory & Vanity Accessory slots, increasing the total amount of accessories one could store to 36.
MostShields, a type of accessory, can synergize with theBrand of the Infernoto block attacks, granting the slowStriking Momentbuff.
Accessories like theMaster Ninja Gearcombine abilities from other accessories too (TheBlack Belt, theTabi, and theTiger Climbing Gearin this situation).
Most accessories (and weapons) can havemodifiersaffecting the user's (or weapons') statistics. Most eligible items will get a modifier upon creation, but an item can also gain one later, or have its modifier changed: ""Reforging"" is a service provided by theGoblin Tinkererat sometimes-considerable cost. Modifiers provide bonuses that are broadly useful, such as movement speed or increased defense, for as long as the item is equipped (this is also required for someinformational accessorieswhose special effects work without being equipped). Accessories can only get bonuses from modifiers, never penalties. Accessory modifiers can provide from 1 to 4 points of defense, 20 points of mana capacity, or from 1%-4% bonus on any of several stats: Damage (for any attack), critical strike chance (any attack except summons), movement speed, or melee speed.  In all cases, the bonus applies only when the item is worn in a non-vanity accessory slot.  Modifier bonuses stack freely, all worn items will accumulate.  Thus by reforging all 5 /6/7allowed accessories to the same modifier, a player can have their choice of +100 /120/140mana capacity, +20 /24/28defense, or +20% /24%/28%on one of the affected statistics."
Aggro,"Aggro, short foraggressionoraggravation, is an invisible statistic that determines the distance at whichenemieswill begin to attack the player.Terrariafeatures various items that can alter this statistic when equipped.
All enemies target the player based on criteria set in theirAI. Most will constantly try for a target, while others may only target if the player is inwater, for example.
Currently, theStardust Guardianis the only summon able to divert an enemy's target away from the player. It overrides the player's presence, but only if it is closer than 200 pixels from said enemy. Otherwise, an enemy may target the player or the Guardian – whichever is closer. It is best to summon the Stardust Guardian closer to hordes of enemies, rather than a small few, to avoid being targeted when a few enemies disperse or die. As of1.4.0.1, the Stardust Guardian targets the closest enemy and whose actions can no longer be influenced by the player.
Armorand other items that ""increase/decrease enemy targeting"" cause enemies to consider a player to be closer or farther away than they actually are. Therefore, having a Stardust Guardian close to an enemy but also having aggro-increasingaccessoriesequipped, the player could be considered ""closer"" than the Stardust Guardian is, potentially resulting in temporarily being targeted instead of the Guardian.
If theEternia Crystalis present, theOld One's Armywill target it by default, only targeting the player or Guardian if they get ""in the way"".
The following items reduce the player's aggro statistic, meaning that enemies will have to get closer to target the player.
These items increase the player's aggro statistic, meaning that enemies can be farther from the player and still target them.
Most enemies will only attack the target they are closest to. They will determine the player's distance first, then the Stardust Guardian's (if applicable) and finally the distance to theEternia Crystal(if applicable). The distance for the player formula is
The result from that formula is then compared to the guardians formula result:
Whichever results in the higher value is targeted.
Enemies in theOld One's Armyfollow a separate formula due to having to attack the player, as well as the crystal. An enemy will first determine the distance between theEternia Crystaland it with a simple distance formula. Then, barring the chance the enemy is currently ""ghosted"", the enemy determines the ""distance"" to the player with the following formula.
Even though this formula does account for aggro, a player will be ignored if they are not within 200 pixels of the specified enemy.[1]Like with regular enemies, if the Guardian is closer to an enemy than the player is, and is within 400 pixels of it, then the Guardian is targeted instead of the player."
Ammunition,"Ammunition itemsare consumable items fired byranged weapons. To fire a weapon that requires ammunition, a compatible ammunition type must be present in the player'sinventory. The ammunition will be taken from the first stack of suitable ammunition, checked in the following order: The four dedicated ammo slots of the inventory from top to bottom, then the main inventory from the top row (hotbar) to the bottom row, going from left to right within each row.
Each type of ammunition adds itsdamage,velocity, andknockbackto the base value of the weapon that fires it. Damage bonuses also apply to the damage ofbulletsandarrows. Someweapons,armor,accessories, andbuffsoffer a chance for each shot to ""conserve"" ammo, firing a shot as usualwithoutconsuming the ammunition. If multiple such items and/or buffs are active, their respective chances to conserve ammo are combined.
Bulletsare fired fromguns.This content is transcluded fromBullets § Types.There are currently 16 different bullets available inTerraria, 11 of which areHardmode-exclusive.
Arrowsare fired frombowsandrepeaters.This content is transcluded fromArrows § Types.There are currently 18 different arrows available inTerraria, 8 of which areHardmode-exclusive.
Rocketsare fired fromlaunchers.This content is transcluded fromRockets § Types.There are currently12 /4 different rockets available inTerraria, all of which areHardmode-exclusive.
Dartsare fired from theBlowpipe,Blowgun,Dart Pistol, andDart Rifle. The Blowpipe and Blowgun can additionally fireSeeds.This content is transcluded fromDarts § Types.There are currently 4 different darts available inTerraria, 3 of which areHardmode-exclusive.

Wire is used to connectmechanismsto triggers and can be placed and removed using various tools. Placed wire will assume the color of theWrenchused, but will always appear asred wirewhen dropped or placed in inventory or ammo slots.SeeWirefor more information, and a complete list of available tools.
By default, every item of ammo fired will be consumed, i.e. removed from the player's inventory. There are certain items, however, that add a chance to prevent consuming the item, effectively conserving ammo occasionally. Note that you can't have an ammo conservation chance of more than 99.99%. The following items have a chance not to consume ammo:
The easiest (or the way that does not heavily depend on the weapon you are using) way to get to the ammo conservation cap is using theAmmo Box,Ammo Reservation Potion,Chlorophyte Helmet,Shroomite Breastplate, and any bow/gun/rocket launcher that has a ammo conservation chance, since none of them are below 20%.
Ammo conservation effects are treated asnon-mutually exclusive events, calculated with the following formula:[2]

For example, using aMinishark() with anAmmo Box() results in a total chance of(46.67% not to consume ammo):

The highest conservation possible is attainable by using a Phantasm with a Magic Quiver, an Ammo Box, an Ammo Reservation Potion, a Vortex Breastplate and a Chlorophyte Helmet. It amounts to 89.8%, which means that, on average, only 102 out of 1000 arrows will be consumed."
Angler,"TheAngleris anNPCconcerned exclusively withcatching fish, who appears as a young child. He does not sell anything, but rather assignsqueststo players. Quest objectives generally involve catching himrare fishfrom particularbiomesorlayers, for which he dispenses various rewards.
OnPC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacy, he will throwFrost Daggerfishat nearby enemies when threatened, dealing 10 /15/17damage at the start of the game.
The Angler is first encountered as theSleeping Anglerrandomly spawning on the sand or on thewatersurface of theOceanbiome (or rarely in the underworld). He will move in when:
The Sleeping Angler is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.
After a quest has been completed, the Angler will reward the player with one item, a number ofCoins, and possibly somebait.
Notes:
Only one of the following special rewards may be obtained. The chances listed are affected by the number of quests completed. Chances are rolled in the order given by the list below, starting from the top. This means rewards near the bottom have a slightly lowered chance of being obtained than what is listed. These chances are not affected byLuck.
If none of the rewards listed above are rewarded, one of the following will be obtained, and in no particular order. Chances are unaffected byLuck, the number of quests completed, nor by the Angler's happiness.
If bait is being rewarded, chances of getting which type are in the order listed below. The chances listed are affected by the number of quests completed. As noted above, chance of obtaining bait ranges from 50% to 100% and is based on the number of quests completed.
The minimum amount of bait obtained is determined by the number of quests completed. Once 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 quests are completed, the minimum amount is increased by 1, for a total of 7 bait. There is also a small chance of obtaining an extra bait if below 250 quests completed.
For more information, seeNPC happiness.
When submerged inShimmer, the Angler will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again.

Armor,"Boy, that sun is hot! I do have some perfectly ventilated armor.
—The Merchant
Armoris a set of equipabledefense itemsthat reduce damage taken fromenemiesand most other damage sources. Armor pieces are equipped by placing them in the armor slots of the player'sinventory. Armor can also be placed invanity slotsto change the player's appearance without affecting stats. Armor pieces are eithercrafted, purchased fromNPCs, or dropped from enemies.
Each piece of armor has adefensestatistic that reduces inflicted damage by half /75%/allits value, rounded up. For example, a full set ofCopper armorprovides a total of 6 defense, reducing damage by 3 /5/6points.Silver armorgrants a total of 13 defense, reducing damage by 7 /10/13points, after having been rounded up. An attack cannot normally be reduced to zero; all attacks will always deal at least 1 damage (or 2 damage for acritical hit), regardless of the quality of a player's armor. The only times an attack can do 0 damage is if the player has invincibility for whatever reason or there is another player on the same team with thePaladin's Shieldequipped and the attack does 1 damage normally.
In addition to the defense provided by individual armor pieces, most armor types provide aSet Bonuswhen all three pieces of the same armor type are worn simultaneously. For the basicpre-Hardmodeorearmors (CopperthroughPlatinum), this is an additional defense bonus. More advanced or unique armors can provide other specialized set bonuses (e.g.,  theShroomite armorwill provide invisibility when not moving).[source 1]
Over all platforms, there are 34 different armor sets obtainable in pre-Hardmode; 35 different armor sets obtainable in Hardmode; 8 robes and 2 wizard hats that give additional buffs; and 10 miscellaneous armor pieces.

While set bonuses are a strong incentive to use a matched set, there are many cases where the powers of individual pieces can be combined usefully, especially late in the game.  Particularly versatile pieces include theValhalla Knight's Breastplatefor its regeneration and theForbidden Treadsfor the extra 2 minions (though theForbidden Treadsnow provide only 1 extra minion in version 1.4, making them less ideal).  Some examples include:"

Attack_speed,"Attack speedinTerrariarefers to the rate at which aweaponcan attack. Despite manymodifiersand effects showing changes to attack or melee speed, attack speed is not an in-game statistic and is instead determined by its reciprocal, known asuse time. This is the amount time it takes to swing (attack with) or use an item. If use time increases, attack speed decreases, and vice versa. For example, a weapon with a use time of 30 will have a lower attack speed (slower rate of fire) than a weapon with a use time of 10. As such, any attack speed modifiers will in actuality act as a variable within theuse time equation. However, as shown below, for many melee weapons a change in attack speed (and therefore use time) will have effects other than a change in use time.
While almost all weapons can receive attack speed modifiers, such as Quick or Legendary, accessories will only ever provide bonuses to melee speed.
Melee speed bonuses affect different types ofmelee weaponsin different ways. For most endgame weapons, it does not increase DPS, as most of them fall into one of the following categories:
Melee speed only affects the actual swinging animation and not the rate at which a weapon fires projectiles, with few exceptions such as theTerra Blade. In other cases, however, the speed at which the projectile fires is the same regardless of having +10% melee speed or +200% melee speed. Melee speed does, however, affect the speed at which the projectile travels. TheTerragrim,Arkhalis, andStarlight's main attacks are considered projectiles, and do not benefit from melee attack speed boosts.
Melee speed bonuses increase the length of aYoyo's string, but not its attack rate. This can be very helpful in the early game, when yoyos are very short and hard to hit bosses with, and against bosses where you need to keep a distance (such asEmpress of Light). The exact multiplier for yoyo string length is(1+3*(melee speed))/4, where melee speed is1.0without buffs. Thus, if the player can reach 2x melee speed through buffs, the yoyo string will be 75% longer.
Similar to yoyos,Flailsdo not attack more often with melee speed boosts, but they reach further and shoot out faster, making them much better at hitting flying targets.
Despite doing summoning damage,Whipsare heavily affected by melee speed, making them one of the few endgame weapons whose DPS is directly affected by melee speed.
Spears gain additional reach from melee speed but not additional DPS. Instead, they move faster during each swing to make up for the increased travel distance.
Boomerangs gain additional range from melee speed."
Bars,"

Barsarecrafting materialsgenerally crafted from minedoresat aFurnace. Crafting most ore-related items requires that raw ores are first crafted into bars.
There are currently 23 different bar types. Obtaining most of these only requires their respective ores as crafting ingredients.Hellstone,Spectre, andShroomite Barsare exceptions that require a secondary material in addition.Hallowed Barsare not crafted but are instead dropped by themechanical bosses. Some bars may also be obtained  fromcrates."
Bestiary,"TheGuideas depicted in the Bestiary's first entry.
TheBestiaryis an in-game catalog ofTerraria'svarious entities, includingenemies,NPCs,critters, andbosses. It can be viewed byopening theinventoryand pressing⚒Use / Attackon thebook icon located to the right of the item trash can, at the bottom right of the inventory, oropening thesettingsand tapping the Bestiary icon. The Bestiary displays a description and basic statistics for each entity, includinghealth,damage,defense, andknockbackresistance, as well as advanced information like item drop rates. Entries can be sorted and filtered by various criteria, like stats, locations,times,events, etc.
The 0-5 Star system in the top left corner reflect the rarity of a given creature.
Initially, no information is available about any particular entity. There are four stages of progression for each entity, each unlocked based on a player's current experience level with that entity in the world:
Progression is tracked by various methods, depending on the entity type:
At the bottom of the Bestiary is a bar that fills as the Bestiary is completed, allowing players to track their progress. Bestiary progress is tied to a world, not a character. Unlocking 10% of the entities in the Bestiary (54 entries) makes theZoologistNPC available, who sells progressively more items (e.g. theCat License) as the player completes more of the Bestiary. Unlocking all information for the entries is not a requirement for this, as long as the entries themselves have been unlocked.
There are 540 Bestiary entries in total.
If the player unlocks 100% of the Bestiary, theZoologistwill sell theUniversal Pylon

Certain enemies in the game do not have distinct Bestiary entries for their variants:
Fish (specifically those obtained as items viafishing, as opposed to fish critters and monsters such as thegoldfishandArapaima) do not have Bestiary entries, despite being living creatures.
Pets, mounts and minions which one may expect to have dedicated entries do not have them either.
Some enemies with entries cannot be obtained at all in given worlds, blocking the completion of the Bestiary:
""Though it is an illusion designed to distract from the true threat, this fake cultist can still use some basic offensive magic as well."""
Biomes,"Biomesare the different types of areas that anyTerrariaworldcan contain. Every biome has its own characteristic terrainblocks, collectibleitems, backdrops,enemies,critters, thememusic,background walls,Angler quest fish, and other features.
Spanning the world's ceiling is theSpacebiome.Biomes on the Surface layerincludeForests,Deserts, theSnow biome, theJungle, theDungeon, theevil biome(eitherthe Corruptionorthe Crimson), and at the far ends of the world, the twoOceans. These Surface biomes extend into theUndergroundlayer.
Going any deeper, the player will find uniquesubterranean variantsof most of these. These include theUnderground Desert,Ice biome, andUnderground Jungle. TheGlowing Mushroom biomealso appears in theCavernlayer, andthe Underworldspans the entire bottom of the world.
OnceHardmodeis activated,a few new biomesform. The world's evil biome roots deeper with theUnderground Corruption/Crimson, and theHallowandUnderground Hallowform as well.
The Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow are all ""contagious"" biomes whichspreadto certain adjacent blocks. Inpre-Hardmode, the evil biomes will only overtake other biomes viagrass,ice,sand, andstone, but once Hardmode begins all three biomes can spread directly through mostsoilblocks,vines, andthorny bushes.
Spaceis the layer that appears at the top of the world. The sky is dark, and even if the sun is still up, the stars are visible.Gravityis decreased in Space.Harpiesspawn here from the start of the game, andWyverns,Arch Wyverns, andMartian Probesduring Hardmode.
Below Space are theSurfaceandUndergroundlayers, separated by the 0 feet line. Biomes usually span both of these layers, and their actual ""underground"" versions do not begin until the depths of theCavernlayer.
Forestsare the most common surface biomes, and are where the player usuallyspawnsupon starting a new world. Greengrassgrows across thedirt, which can spawnMushrooms,Dayblooms, andtrees. Forests appear whenever no other biome is valid.
TheSnow biomeis a winter-themed biome predominately made ofSnowandIce Blocks. Snow falls constantly, though this is only an aesthetic effect. Relative to the world's horizontal center, the Snow biome is always located on the same side as theDungeonand on the opposite side of theJungle.[1]
Desertsare large expanses ofSand. Their vegetation is comparatively sparse, consisting solely ofCacti. Multiple Deserts can generate, and there will always be at least one Underground Desert.
A world will always generate with anevil biome– eitherCrimsonorCorruption, but never both (unless indrunk worlds). There is a50*1/2 (50%)chance of either of the evil biomes generating,although it can be selected manually upon world creation (provided theWall of Fleshhas been defeated in a separate world before). The evil biomes are hazardous biomes with mostly analogous contents:
TheJungleis composed ofJungle grass,vines,Mud,BambooandMahogany trees. The sky appears a vibrant green color. Mahogany trees regrow automatically without the need to plantAcorns. Relative to the horizontal center of the world, the Jungle is always located on the opposite side of theSnow biomeand theDungeon,[1]and the same side as the Underground Desert.
TheDungeonis a labyrinth leading from the Surface down to near-Underworld depths. TheOld Manstands at the entrance, and using him to defeatSkeletronis required to gain access to the inside. Heading below 0 feet in the Dungeon without defeatingSkeletronspawns one or moreDungeon Guardians, which have enormous defense and are capable of one-hitting even endgame players. The loot found in the Dungeon is rare, valuable, and much of it cannot be found elsewhere. Relative to the world's horizontal center, the Dungeon is always located on the same side as the Snow biome and on the opposite side of theJungle. The color of theDungeonis randomly selected at world creation, it can be blue, green, or pink[1]
Oceansconsist of a deep body ofwaterwhere dangerous swimming enemies are found andWater Chestswhich contain ocean-themed loot. They are always located on both horizontal edges of the world.Duke Fishroncan be summoned here with aTruffle Worm. TheMagic Conchcan be used to teleport the player to an Ocean.
The surface version of theGlowing Mushroom biomedoes not occur naturally, and can only be cultivated by players usingMushroom Grass Seedsor an importedClentaminatorwithDark Blue Solutionon surface-levelMud Blocks.
TheUndergroundlayer marks the beginning of distinct underground biome variants, with separate characteristics from their surface versions.
TheIce biomeis the Underground layer's more dangerous portion of the Snow biome and is located beneath the surface part. Many ledges and bodies of water will have a layer ofThin Iceover them, and while these can support the player's weight they can break when landing on them with high enough speed.Frozen Chestscontain ice-themed equipment.
TheUnderground Desertis located beneath the surface Desert. The biome always has either a circular or an oval shape and contains various types ofAntlionsas well asHardmodeenemies themed after ancient Egypt.
TheUnderground Jungleis located beneath the surface Jungle. Its dense catacomb of compartments contain several hazards and dense vegetation. In Hardmode, the valuableChlorophyte Orecan be mined here. Three bosses can be fought in this biome: An Underground Jungle always contains severalBee Hives, where theQueen Beeboss is usually summoned. After themechanical bosseshave been defeated,Plantera's Bulbsspawn, allowing the player to summonPlantera. TheJungle Templeis also located within the Underground Jungle, where theGolemboss can be summoned after Plantera is defeated.
TheUnderground Glowing Mushroom biomefeaturesGlowing Mushroomson top ofMud Blocks, and if there is enough empty vertical space,Giant Glowing Mushroomscan grow as well. It is the only place whereTruffle Wormscan be obtained.
The Underworldspans the entire bottom of the world.Lavapools cover much of its terrain and dangerous enemies spawn frequently.Hellstonecan be mined here,Ruined Housesoffer valuable loot (some within theirShadow Chests), and unique furniture, and theWall of Fleshbosscan be summoned here in order to activateHardmode. In Hardmode, theTortured Soulspawns in the Underworld, which can be converted to theTax CollectorNPCusingPurification Powder.
Hardmode biomes spawn or convert as a result of the game transitioning toHardmode.
The Hallowcan be considered the counterpart to theevil biome. It is automatically created once the player activatesHardmodeby defeating theWall of Flesh, and has pastel-colored fairy-tale imagery.
TheUnderground Hallowis located beneath the surface Hallow, starting at the Cavern layer. It has a different soundtrack from the surface Hallow, and contains different enemies as well as valuable items, such asSouls of LightandCrystal Shards.
TheUnderground Corruptionis created in theCavernlayer upon defeating theWall of Flesh. It is not necessarily located beneath pre-Hardmode surface Corruption biomes. While it shares the theme with the surface Corruption, it has different enemies and a different soundtrack (a mix of the regular Underground and Corruption soundtrack). It is the only place where enemies dropCursed Flames. It and the Underground Crimson are the only places to obtainSouls of Night, which are occasionally dropped by all enemies.
TheUnderground Crimsonis the alternative to the Underground Corruption, which functions and generates in mostly the same way. The Underground Crimson, like the Corruption variant, will have enemies occasionally dropSouls of Night. It is the only place where enemies dropIchor.
When the world enters Hardmode, severalDesertsof the world will become eitherCorrupted,Crimsoned, orHallowed. These spawn unique versions of theMummyandSand Sharkwith unique drops.Sandis replaced byEbonsand,Crimsand, orPearlsand. It is possible for a pre-Hardmode world to be generated with a Corrupted or Crimson Desert.
When the world enters Hardmode, theCorruption,Crimson, andHallowcan spread through theIce biome, generatingPurple,Red, andPink Ice Blocks, respectively.Pigronsof the respective color start to spawn in these areas.
Biomes in this category tend to be small in number and size. They generally have unique characteristics and enemy or critter spawns, but usually have neither unique backgrounds nor music.
TheAetheris a small cave with a pool ofShimmerlocated in theCavernlayer.  It is found on the same side of the world as theJungle, located between it and theOcean. The Aether generates withGem Trees, andFaelingscan be found flying above the shimmer.
Bee Hivesare located in theUnderground Jungle. They are made fromHiveblocks and containhoneyand often aLarva. Destroying the Larva summons theQueen Beeboss. Breaking a Hive block may spawn aBeeand/or some honey.
Granite Cavesare cave areas made completely ofGranite Blocks, usually fairly spacious with interspersed ledges and platforms. They contain granite-themed enemies such asGranite ElementalsandGranite Golems.
Marble Cavesare cave areas that are horizontal in shape and made completely out ofMarble Blocks. They contain ancient-Greek-themed enemies such asHoplitesandMedusas.
Graveyardsappear around large clusters ofTombstones. They generateEcto Mistand spawn enemies such asRavens,GhostsandMaggot Zombies, as well as spawn the typical nighttime enemies, even during the day. They are not generated naturally, but instead are made by the player. To get rid of a graveyard, destroy all of the gravestones.
TheOasisis a mini-biome that spawns in theDesert. It consists of palm trees surrounding a pool of water where cattail plants grow, attractingDragonflies. If there is enough water in an area of the Desert, it will become an Oasis.
The glowing moss biome is located in theCavernslevel of the world, but cannot be found under thespawnarea. Nearly every piece ofStone Blockis covered inKrypton,XenonorArgon Mossand every instance found in a single world will use the same moss variant. This mini-biome is much larger than theMoss chamber. There can be up to two to four instances of this biome, depending onworld size, though there is no guarantee that any are generated. There are no unique enemies in glowing moss biomes.
TheJungle Templeis a large, nearly impenetrable structure that spawns deep in the Underground Jungle. It is filled with powerful enemies and is generally only accessible after defeatingPlantera, using theTemple Keyshe drops to open the door. In the largest chamber, there is aLihzahrd Altarto spawnGolemwith aLihzahrd Power Cell.
The Meteorite biome is sometimes generated after the playerdefeats theEater of WorldsorBrain of Cthulhu/breaks aShadow OrborCrimson Heart. There is a50*1/2 (50%)chance that within the next day at midnight the game will spawn a Meteorite, converting an area of the Surface into a crater with three layers. Blocks in the innermost area will be deleted without dropping anything; surrounding this, all blocks around the empty area will be converted intoMeteoriteore; and in a much larger radius outside this mass of ore, only occasional blocks similarly converted. Meteorite ore will afflict the player with theBurningdebuff on contact, unless they either have anaccessoryto nullify its effects, or are under the effect of anObsidian Skin Potion. Mining Meteorite requires 50%pickaxe power, i.e. aTungsten Pickaxe,Gold Pickaxe, or better is mandatory.Meteor Heads(and, in Hardmode,Lava Bats) override all native enemies of the biome the meteor crashed into.
Spider Cavesare characterized by black background walls and numerous webs filling the area. This mini-biome will spawnWall Creepersin pre-Hardmode andBlack Reclusesduring Hardmode. TheCobwebsrapidly grow back, which is a unique feature of the biome. Spider Caves are the only location whereWeb Covered Chestsare found, and therefore the only place to obtain aWeb Slinger. TheStylistNPCis found in this mini-biome.
ATownis a player-created mini-biome that can be made by having three or more NPCs in close proximity. In Normal mode, they negate enemy spawn rates entirely; even in Expert and Master mode they will sharply reduce enemy spawns. However, enemy spawns are not affected when aneventis occurring.
May or may not be considered biomes. These are usually small and have no unique enemies or properties.
Campsites are found in theUndergroundandCavernlayers, usually containing aCampfire, a fewSilver/Gold Coin Piles, and abackground objectof skeletal remains. The campsite is 12–20 blocks wide, and not quite as tall.
Flower patches are small patches ofSurfaceground densely populated by flowers.
Gemstone cavesare filled with concentrated gem deposits of one or more varieties and feature a unique background (a gemstone wall) that is speckled with gems of the same color found in the gemstone cave.
Large ore veins are located at the surfacelayerand consist of a large vein ofCopper/TinorIron/Lead Oreburied near the ground, with a few ore blocks above it.
Mosaics are found in theUndergroundandCavernlayers, consisting of a small room with tiles randomly set inside, with a pile of gold coins in it.
Moss chambers are very small chambers located in the Underground and Cavern layers that contain one color ofmosswith a matching back wall.
Thin Ice patches are micro-biomes found in theIce biomethat are made entirely ofThin Iceand occasionaloreveins.
Stone patches are small patches of ground made of stone found at the surface, consisting ofStone Blockswith matchingambient objectson the top.
Enchanted Sword Shrineshouse anEnchanted Sword, aTerragrim/Arkhalis, or a fake sword. Every shrine will contain one breakable background sword sprite, which has a66.67*2/3 (66.67%)chance of being a fake sword and a33.33*1/3 (33.33%)chance of being a real sword, which has a10*1/10 (10%)chance of dropping the Terragrim/Arkhalis instead of the Enchanted Sword when destroyed.
Floating Islandsare independent masses of land in the sky. They contain aSkyware Chestwith valuable loot like theStarfurysword, theShiny Red Balloon,theFledgling Wings, oraLucky Horseshoe. Deposits oforecan be found sometimes as well. Depending on world size, there are between two and nine Floating Islands in a world.
Floating Lakesare a variation of Floating Islands and do not contain a Skyware Chest.
Jungle Shrinesare small brick buildings and typically contain only a singleIvy Chestand alight source. They are found in theUnderground Jungleand several can appear in one biome.
Living Treesare huge, thick trees consisting of foreground blocks (as opposed to regular backgroundtrees). Cutting the tree yields regularWood, while the leaves yield nothing. Some Living Trees can be hollow and lead deep underground. There may be rooms containingLiving Wood Chestswith related loot inside, as well asLiving Wood furniture. It is not guaranteed that one will spawn in every world. In 1.4,Gnomesspawn in hollow Living Trees.
Living Mahogany Treesare large trees generated in the Underground Jungle. Cutting the tree yieldsRich Mahoganywood, while the leaves yield nothing. They always have a hollow trunk, which contains an Ivy Chest.
Pyramidsare rarely generated in theDesertupon world creation. They are made ofSandstone Bricksand contain a narrow passage. The treasure room is filled with Coin Stashes, vases and aGold Chestthat can contain unique loot. There is also a passage to a cave at the bottom.
Ruined Housesare generated upon world creation inThe Underworldin the middle 50% of the Underworld. They are towers with multiple levels, constructed with missing parts for a ""ruined"" look, fromObsidian BrickorHellstone Brick. They are sometimes partially submerged inlavaand there are often deposits ofHellstonejust outside their walls.
Underground Cabinsare found in theCavernlayer. They are typically wooden buildings full of dusty, broken furniture as well as Chests, vases, and occasionally usable furniture and decorations. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Underground Cabins spawn with blocks representing their biome.
If the player patches the holes in the walls and fulfills allNPCrequirements,NPCscan move in.
The following two structures were exclusive to theMobile version, and were removed in theMobile 1.3.0.7update.
Heart Shrineswere heart-shaped caves sometimes found in Snow biomes. They held twoCrystal Heartsand a Chest that contained heart-themed items for the Valentine's Day celebration event.
AJungle Sanctumwas a structure that occasionally appeared in the Jungle. Jungle Sanctums were larger versions of Jungle Shrines and contained Coin Stashes, along with anIvy Chestthat contained several Jungle-themed items.
Although many basic biomes appear at the world generation or are triggered by events, hybrid biomes may be synthesized by world mechanics or through player action.
Hybrid biomes are those created by the requirements being met for multiple biomes in a certain area. The simplest examples are Hallowed, Crimson, and Corrupted Deserts; however, not only Deserts can be hybridized. Floating Islands can be Corrupted/Crimsoned or Hallowed upon entry of Hardmode, and such high-layered biomes are even required by someAnglerquests. Player action can similarly introduce Corruption, Crimson, Hallow, Desert, Jungle, Mushroom, Meteorite, or Snow biomes to any location from Underworld to Space. This can lead to, for example in an Underworld Crimson, Underworld and Crimson enemies both spawning in the applicable areas.
The area used for counting required blocks for the existence of biomes at a location appears to be85 /50 tiles to each side and approximately61 /42 below and64 /44 above, from the location of the player. Biomes are set in the order listed below. Worthy of note is that many areas not conventionally considered as biomes are treated as such in the code.
EachSunflowersubtracts80 /40[4]/5 from the game's count of Corruption blocks, and each Hallow block subtracts 1.
EachSunflowersubtracts80 /40[4]/5 from the game's count of Crimson blocks, and each Hallow block subtracts 1.
Each Corruption or Crimson block which is also within range subtracts 1 from the game's count of Hallow blocks.
Note that while this is the order in which the game sets biomes as being extant in the player's vicinity, other applications of biomes check in different orders. For example:"
Blocks,"All blocks as of1.4.2.1.
Some blocks being placed.
Blocksare the primary components of everyTerrariaworld. They make up nearly all of the game's terrain, with the preponderance of a particular block type in an area determining itsbiome. Nearly all blocks are collectible for use by players, and are mined with aPickaxe,Drill, or an explosive. All block types can be stacked up to 9999 in a singleinventoryslot.
There are currently 192 block types, including natural, crafted, purchased, and summoned block types.
These blocks are created when the world is generated. Though few of them are renewable, more can always be found by generating new worlds.
Soils are the most accessible type of block in the game, and they make up the majority of the world. Many of them growPlantsnaturally. All soils can be mined with aCopper PickaxeorTin Pickaxe(except for theStonevariants as noted below). Soils are the only blocks that can be converted bythe Corruption,Crimson, andHallow. All soils are destroyed byexplosives.
These blocks drop when their respective plant is looted from the environment using the necessary tool. Once in the player's inventory, they can be placed like other blocks and likewise looted with aPickaxe,Drill, orexplosives.
These blocks are found in various parts of the world.
Trapblocks are likewise found throughout the world. Unlike other blocks they feature special abilities which can be activated by atriggerthroughWire. All trap blocks can be destroyed byexplosives. As of1.3.1, their direction of fire can be changed with anyHammer.
Oresare found underground (With the exception ofLuminiteandMeteorite), some types only in certain biomes. They are used in the crafting ofBars, which in turn are used to craftWeapons,Armor,Furniture, and more. Many are used to make Bricks or other blocks.
Gemsare valuable materials that can be found in veins underground. They can be found in two forms; as gem blocks embedded in Stone Blocks or on the sides of Stone Blocks, or as background objects placed onto Stone Blocks. Mining either version will provide the respective gem type. Gem blocks can be created by the player in thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version.
Amberis also a gem, but can only be obtained fromSilt,SlushorDesert Fossils. In thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, it can also be found on blocks in theUnderground Desert.
Bricks are a specific type of crafted block with a repeating rectangular pattern. Though many bricks are crafted from ores and soils, some can only be looted from the environment (or inone case, enemies). All Bricks have the word 'Brick' in their name (however,Mudstone Brickis called Mudstone Block on).
Bricks have no sell value. Most crafted bricks are made using aFurnace, Hellforge and/or Titanium/Adamantite Forge.
These blocks are obtained through crafting at acrafting station.
These blocks are bought fromNPCs.
These blocks are obtained in various ways, mostly as drops from enemies."
Blood_Moon,"You can tell a Blood Moon is out when the sky turns red. There is something about it that causes monsters to swarm.
—The Guide
ABlood Moonis a randomeventthat takes place atnight, from 7:30PM to 4:30AM, affecting only thesurfacelayer.A Blood Moon can also be initiated when the player uses aBloody Tear. It causes several hazards for its duration: Enemy spawns increase, even near the player'sHomeandNPCs(where enemies do not normally spawn),Zombiesbecome able to openDoors, andBunnies,Penguins, andGoldfishtransform into dangerous enemies, along with other effects (see below). Blood Moons are signaled by the message ""The Blood Moon is rising..."" in the lower left corner of the screen (or the top middle of the screen onMobile). Themoon,sky,water, andrainwill appear red for the duration of the event. A reddish-pink filter will also be present in all above-ground areas. Blood Moons disable the ability to speed up time whilst sleeping in abed.
In order for a Blood Moon to naturally occur, the following criteria must be met[1]:
A Blood Moon can be initiated manually at nighttime by using aBloody Tearand does not require said criteria to be met.

Red rain during a Blood Moon"
Bosses#Hardmode_bosses,"Bossesare aggressive, resilientenemiesthat offer a substantial challenge to players. Defeating a boss is usually instrumental in advancing the game in some way or another, for example, granting the player a new material for a pickaxe of a higher tier. Each has its own particular way of being summoned. For example, most bosses have associatedsummoning itemsthat can be used to spawn them manually under certain conditions, while there are others that will appear after the player interacts in a certain way with the environment.Eventbosses will only appear during their respective events and leave when the event ends. Mini-bosses also exist and appear only during special events, expressing the same amount of difficulty as many normal bosses. Their health has a huge range: On Classic Mode it ranges from 1,000 to 273,000.
Most bosses and mini-bosses can pass throughblocksof all types, with the exception ofKing Slime,Queen Slime,Lepus,Turkor the Ungrateful'sbody, and theFlying Dutchman.
For all non-event bosses, with the exception of theLunatic Cultist,status messageswill appear when that boss is about to spawn or has already spawned. Upon spawning, its particular thememusicplays. During events, bosses and mini-bosses can appear multiple times and have no distinct spawn message. In the case of wave events like thePumpkinandFrost Moonsand theOld One's Army, status messages that appear at the start of each wave can indicate whether or not a certain boss or mini-boss will appear. Defeating a non-event boss concludes with a congratulatory message and several reward items.
On thePC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacyversions, bosses will appear on theminimap, each with an individual map icon. On thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderversions, aboss health barwill appear on the screen. (Note that it will only show the health of the most recently-attacked boss, if there are multiple. This is most prevalent when fightingThe Twins.)
All enemies that can spawn naturally have a better chance of spawning if the player stands near a placedWater Candleor while under the effects of aBattle Potion.
These are the first bosses the player can encounter. Usually, defeating one of these bosses will give the player items and materials necessary to progress in the game, eventually leading toHardmode. Although there are 8pre-Hardmodebosses, only 7 can be spawned in the same world, asEater of Worldsis exclusive to worlds containingthe Corruption, andBrain of Cthulhuis exclusive to worlds containingthe Crimson(assuming the player does not place an alternate evil in the same world as the other one, e.g. via seeds from another world orseeds purchased from theDryadNPC in Hardmode, and does not use aDrunk world seed).
For elaborate strategies on defeating King Slime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:King Slime strategies.
King Slimeis a giant blueslimewith 2,000 /2,800/3,570health. It is summoned with aSlime Crown, or after killing 150 (75 if it has already been killed) slimes during aSlime Rain, or can also rarely appear in the outer thirds of the map completely by itself.
On thePC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacyversions, King Slime can teleport to the player if it gets trapped or if the player gets out of reach for too long.
King Slime does not provide access to game-advancing items upon defeat, but outsideExpert Modewill drop one GoldCoin, oneor two piece(s)ofNinja clothes, and one of several slime-related items.
InExpert Mode(andMaster Mode), King Slime can summonSpiked Slimes, that are similar to theSpiked Jungle SlimeandSpiked Ice Slime.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Eye of Cthulhu, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Eye of Cthulhu strategies.
Eye of Cthulhuis a huge eyeball with 2,800 /3,640/4,641health. It has a33.33*1/3 (33.33%)chance of spawning at the beginning of eachnightonce a player in the world has 200 max health or more and over 10defense, and there are 3 or moreNPCsliving in houses. It will continue to do so until defeated for the first time. It can also be summoned by using aSuspicious Looking Eyeat night. If not defeated by the player by the end of the night, it will travel upwards and despawn. This is generally the first boss a player must face. It travels throughblocks, and spawnsServants of Cthulhu.
InExpert Mode(andMaster Mode), the Eye of Cthulhu will do a fast chain dash in its second form, using the attack more often the lower health it has. The chain dash attack will also scale in aggressiveness the same way. This can lead to it dashing almost continually at high velocity at very low health.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Eater of Worlds, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Eater of Worlds strategies.
Eater of Worldsis a colossal worm with 10,050 /15,120/19,224health in total on thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderversions, and 7,500 health on theOld-gen console,Windows Phone,Old Chinese,3DS, andtModLoader Legacyversions. It spawns after every thirdShadow Orbis broken or afterWorm Foodis used. Shadow Orbs are found inthe Corruptionchasms, surrounded byEbonstone, which requires apickaxewith 65%pickaxe poweror higher to mine, althoughexplosivesorPurification Powdercan be used to bypass this. Once within range, Shadow Orbs can be destroyed with ahammeror explosives. The Eater of Worlds can only be summoned in the Corruption, and can be summoned at any time of the day. If it manages to escape the Corruption, it will flee and disappear.
Eater of Worlds is a largeworm-typeenemy that travels through tiles, and is made up of multiple sections that can each attack separately when cut off. To defeat it, every section must be brought down to less than two body parts to be killed (the smallest possible section is a head and a tail with no body pieces). Due to how helpful Corruption gear is, this will probably be the second boss faced in worlds that have Corruption, rather than those who haveCrimson.
The Eater of Worlds is extremely vulnerable to piercing and true melee due to the fact that all body parts take damage seperately, so it is recommended to use a bow (Platinum/Gold, or Demon Bow if you are willing to farm the small natural Demonite patches in Corruption worlds) along with Unholy arrows for piercing, and Jester arrows for even more piercing if you have them.
Eater of Worlds is the only source ofShadow Scalesin the game, and it drops large amounts ofDemonite Ore. The Demonite Ore can be sold for almost10per 99, making this technically the best pre-Hardmode boss for farming in the game.
InExpert Mode, the boss is able to shoot dark-green projectiles at the player calledVile Spit, similar to those fired fromCorruptors, another Corruption-exclusive enemy. In worlds withFor the worthyorGet fixed boiseeds, if a segment is defeated it will spawn a giantEater of Souls.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Brain of Cthulhu, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Brain of Cthulhu strategies.
Brain of Cthulhuis a large, flying brain with a mere 1,250 /2,125/2,709health, giving it the lowest amount of health out of any boss. It spawns for every thirdCrimson Heartthat is broken or immediately after aBloody Spineis used. Crimson Hearts are found inthe Crimson's chasms, surrounded byCrimstone, which can be bypassed with the same methodsEbonstonecan. However, some of the pockets containing these will generate open. Once within range, Crimson Hearts can be destroyed with aHammeror any explosive. It can only be summoned in the Crimson, but at any time of day.
Brain of Cthulhu has two forms. In the first form, the brain cannot be harmed, andCreeperswill float around it. After all of these are killed, the Brain of Cthulhu will go into its second form, where it will teleport more frantically and move a lot faster. Brain of Cthulhu's second form attacks by ramming into the player, like the second form ofEye of Cthulhu. Unlike most other bosses, the Brain of Cthulhu is not immune toknockback.
Brain of Cthulhu is the only source ofTissue Samplesin the game (other than the Creepers spawned while fighting it), and drops a large amount ofCrimtane Ore, which are the Crimson equivalents to the Corruption itemsShadow ScaleandDemonite Ore, respectively.
InExpert Mode, in Brain of Cthulhu's second form, it will start creating illusions of itself to charge at the player. The lower the Brain of Cthulhu's health gets, the less obvious the illusions become, to the point where they will look exactly like the real Brain of Cthulhu.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Queen Bee, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Queen Bee strategies.
Queen Beeis an enormous bee with 3,400 /4,760/6,069health. It is summoned by destroying aLarva, encased within the walls ofBee Hiveslocated in theUnderground Jungle, or by the use of anAbeeminationanywhere in theJunglebiome. It is the only source ofBee Waxin the game.
Queen Bee alternates between charging at the player, hovering above them whilst spawningBees, and moving left and right whilst shooting stingers. InExpert Mode, the rate at which it charges the player gets faster the more damage it takes.
Defeating Queen Bee will allow theWitch Doctorto spawn; other than this, it does not advance the game in a major sense, though defeating it does provide some decent loot that can further help the player prepare for other boss battles, such as against theWall of Flesh. One such weapon is theBeenade, which is extremely effective when fighting the Wall of Flesh.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron strategies.
Skeletronis a large skeletal head with 4,400 /8,800/11,220health and two hands. It is initially summoned by speaking to theOld ManNPCat the entrance of theDungeonand activating his curse atnight, but can be summoned again by killing theClothierwhile equipped with theClothier Voodoo Dollat night.
Skeletron will alternate between attacking the player with its hands and performing a spinning attack. Its hands can be attacked and defeated to make the battle easier, although this is not required. If it has not been defeated before the night is over, Skeletron will spin at a high speed, dealing very large amounts of damage that usually kill the player in one hit, until either it is defeated or all players are dead.
InExpert Mode, Skeletron's head is more resistant to damage until its hands are destroyed. Once one hand is destroyed, it will start shooting homing skulls at the player. It is also much faster. Its hands inflict theSlowdebuff, and its head inflictsBleeding. If the player gets caught by its head-spin attack, Skeletron can ""stun-lock"" them, a lethal situation that can only be escaped by high mobility, e.g. with ahook.
DefeatingSkeletronwill stopDungeon Guardiansfrom spawning, allowing free access to the Dungeon.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Deerclops, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Deerclops strategies.
Deerclopsis a large, upright, one eyed deer with 7,000 /11,900/15,172health. It can spawn atmidnightduring aBlizzardif one player in the world has at least either 9defenseor 200health. If Deerclops has previously been defeated in the world, there is only a25*1/4 (25%)chance of this occurring. It can be summoned by using aDeer Thingat any time while in theSnow biome.
Deerclops has four /fiveattacks:
Notes:
For elaborate strategies on defeating Wall of Flesh, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Wall of Flesh strategies.
Wall of Fleshis a towering wall that spans the entire screen height. It has 8,000 /11,200/14,280health. It is summoned by throwing aGuide Voodoo Dollinto a pool oflavawhile theGuideis alive. Defeating it will irreversibly initiateHardmodein the world. It can drop several powerful items, one of them being the guaranteed dropPwnhammerwhich can be used to breakDemon AltarsorCrimson Altarsin order to spawn various game-advancingHardmode ores.
Upon summoning Wall of Flesh, the player will be afflicted with theHorrifieddebuff, which prevents fleeing from the battle – any attempt to do so will result in severe damage viaThe Tongueor instant death if the player tries to teleport away, and the debuff will not be removed until either the player or the Wall of Flesh is killed. Wall of Flesh will then sweep across the map, moving faster as its health gets lower. It must be killed before it reaches the end of the map, otherwise it will despawn and any living players in the Underworld will instantly die. Additionally, Wall of Flesh's eyes fire lasers, with the rate of fire increasing as it takes damage. Its mouth burpsLeechesthat will chase the player, and it has small mouths attached to it called The Hungry, which will also move toward and damage the player.
InExpert Mode, Wall of Flesh will greatly increase its movement speed as its health decreases, eventually surpassing even players riding theBunny Mountorhorse mountsin movement speed. The Hungry will rapidly respawn, thus seemingly blocking the wall from attacks, and can deal significant damage themselves. The faster Wall of Flesh moves and the quicker The Hungry respawn, the more the player will have to focus on dealing damage and moving across a decent terrain.
Hardmodebosses are significantly stronger than previous bosses.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Queen Slime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Queen Slime strategies.
Queen Slimeis a giant slime with 18,000 /28,800/36,720health. It is available to battle at the start of Hardmode, and is summoned fromGelatin Crystalsin theUnderground Hallow. It is an optional boss fight and is a small gap to challenge before facing themechanical bosses, warranting equipment upgrades and other items. There is a very strong resemblance to thepre-HardmodeKing Slime, and is one of two Hallowed bosses featured in the game.
As it takes damage it spawnsCrystal Slimes,Bouncy Slimes, andHeavenly Slimesto aid it.  While its first form is straightforward with attack patterns similar to that of King Slime's, the second form poses much more of a threat as the boss begins to fly in the air, shooting projectiles from above.
For elaborate strategies on defeating The Twins, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:The Twins strategies.
The Twinsare a pair of cyberneticEyes of Cthulhu. They exist as two individual entities, known asRetinazerandSpazmatism, with the former having 20,000 /30,000/38,250health and the latter having 23,000 /34,500/43,987health. The Twins are summoned using aMechanical Eyeat night. It is worth noting that they will gaindefensein their second forms, unlike the Eye of Cthulhu.
The two eyes have different fighting styles. Retinazer focuses on shooting the player with Death Lasers like theDestroyer'sProbes. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, replacing its pupil with a laser cannon. During this form, it will shoot lasers extremely fast, sometimes having the same fire rate as aMegashark.
The other eye, Spazmatism, focuses on slamming into the player and firing cursed flames. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, resembling a mechanical version of the Eye of Cthulhu's second form. It will deal a lot more damage, and the flames it shoots are more consistent like theFlamethrowerinstead of theCursed Flames, but the flames will still inflictCursed Infernodebuff on the player. The last Twin destroyed will drop all of the loot.
InExpert Mode, Retinazer will shoot lasers faster, and Spazmatism charges faster in its second form.
For elaborate strategies on defeating The Destroyer, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:The Destroyer strategies.
The Destroyeris a colossal mechanizedEater of Worldswith 80,000 /120,000/153,000health. It is considered the easiest Hardmode boss by many players, despite having the second-highest health.
The Destroyer is summoned by crafting and using aMechanical Wormanywhere, but can only be spawned at night.
Although it is similar to its pre-Hardmode counterpart, the Eater of Worlds, it has some key differences: it will not divide into smaller segments, will shoot lasers from its body if space is available, and will deployProbesto attack once a segment is destroyed.
The Destroyer will shoot Death Lasers, increasing in attack speed as it loses health. Weapons that deal damage to multiple segments likeFlails,Daedalus Stormbow, and theDemon Scytheare recommended, because they will hit multiple sections of The Destroyer at once.
InExpert Mode, The Destroyer's head can deal damage as high as280/420, crippling the player if they are hit head-on.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron Prime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron Prime strategies.
Skeletron Primeis a weaponized mechanical variation ofSkeletron, with the head alone having 28,000 /42,000/53,550health. Instead of two hands, it has four limbs – a vice, laser gun, saw, and cannon. With the head and all limbs combined, Skeletron Prime has 59,000 /88,500/112,836health.
Skeletron Prime can be summoned by using aMechanical Skullat night.
Like Skeletron, only the head has to be defeated. It is more mobile than its predecessor, and it regularly flies off-screen, making targeting more difficult. It is also worth noting that when its head spins, itsdefensedoubles from 24 to 48, unlike Skeletron, whose defense is dropped to 0 when spinning.
Skeletron Prime will dropHallowed BarsandSouls of Frightupon being defeated, which are both used to craft many kinds of armor and tools. Like Skeletron, if Prime is not killed before the night ends, it will spin and target the player, generally killing the player in one hit, and will despawn afterwards.
InExpert Mode, Skeletron Prime moves significantly faster during its spinning attack, similarly toSkeletron.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Mechdusa, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Mechdusa strategies.
TheMechdusais an amalgamation of the 3Mechanical bosseswith 273000 /348073/530073health.
It can only be summoned with theOcram's Razoron the ""Everything"" akaGet fixed boiWorld seed.
Mechdusa serves as an alternate fight route for the Mechanical Bosses, as the bosses cannot be fought separately on Everything-seeded worlds, instead forcing you to fight them all at once as Mechdusa.

Despite not being the final boss of the game, Mechdusa has the highest health for any single boss. Even in Classic Mode, Mechdusa tops the Moon Lord's 
with roughly twice the amount of health.

When the True Eyes of Cthulhu are released, the places where they used to be will inflict minor contact damage. The True Eyes of Cthulhu will fire less damaging versions of many of the same attacks as they did when they were still enclosed within the Moon Lord.
InExpert Mode, Moon Lord's Phantasmal Deathray attack deals a lot more damage, enough to kill most players in one hit.

Bosses#Pre-Hardmode_bosses,"Bossesare aggressive, resilientenemiesthat offer a substantial challenge to players. Defeating a boss is usually instrumental in advancing the game in some way or another, for example, granting the player a new material for a pickaxe of a higher tier. Each has its own particular way of being summoned. For example, most bosses have associatedsummoning itemsthat can be used to spawn them manually under certain conditions, while there are others that will appear after the player interacts in a certain way with the environment.Eventbosses will only appear during their respective events and leave when the event ends. Mini-bosses also exist and appear only during special events, expressing the same amount of difficulty as many normal bosses. Their health has a huge range: On Classic Mode it ranges from 1,000 to 273,000.
Most bosses and mini-bosses can pass throughblocksof all types, with the exception ofKing Slime,Queen Slime,Lepus,Turkor the Ungrateful'sbody, and theFlying Dutchman.

During events, bosses and mini-bosses can appear multiple times and have no distinct spawn message. In the case of wave events like thePumpkinandFrost Moonsand theOld One's Army, status messages that appear at the start of each wave can indicate whether or not a certain boss or mini-boss will appear. Defeating a non-event boss concludes with a congratulatory message and several reward items.

This is most prevalent when fightingThe Twins.)
All enemies that can spawn naturally have a better chance of spawning if the player stands near a placedWater Candleor while under the effects of aBattle Potion.
These are the first bosses the player can encounter. Usually, defeating one of these bosses will give the player items and materials necessary to progress in the game, eventually leading toHardmode. Although there are 8pre-Hardmodebosses, only 7 can be spawned in the same world, asEater of Worldsis exclusive to worlds containingthe Corruption, andBrain of Cthulhuis exclusive to worlds containingthe Crimson(assuming the player does not place an alternate evil in the same world as the other one, e.g. via seeds from another world orseeds purchased from theDryadNPC in Hardmode, and does not use aDrunk world seed).

If it manages to escape the Corruption, it will flee and disappear.
Eater of Worlds is a largeworm-typeenemy that travels through tiles, and is made up of multiple sections that can each attack separately when cut off. To defeat it, every section must be brought down to less than two body parts to be killed (the smallest possible section is a head and a tail with no body pieces). Due to how helpful Corruption gear is, this will probably be the second boss faced in worlds that have Corruption, rather than those who haveCrimson.
The Eater of Worlds is extremely vulnerable to piercing and true melee due to the fact that all body parts take damage seperately, so it is recommended to use a bow (Platinum/Gold, or Demon Bow if you are willing to farm the small natural Demonite patches in Corruption worlds) along with Unholy arrows for piercing, and Jester arrows for even more piercing if you have them.
Eater of Worlds is the only source ofShadow Scalesin the game, and it drops large amounts ofDemonite Ore. The Demonite Ore can be sold for almost10per 99, making this technically the best pre-Hardmode boss for farming in the game.

After all of these are killed, the Brain of Cthulhu will go into its second form, where it will teleport more frantically and move a lot faster. Brain of Cthulhu's second form attacks by ramming into the player, like the second form ofEye of Cthulhu. Unlike most other bosses, the Brain of Cthulhu is not immune toknockback.
Brain of Cthulhu is the only source ofTissue Samplesin the game (other than the Creepers spawned while fighting it), and drops a large amount ofCrimtane Ore, which are the Crimson equivalents to the Corruption itemsShadow ScaleandDemonite Ore, respectively.
InExpert Mode, in Brain of Cthulhu's second form, it will start creating illusions of itself to charge at the player. The lower the Brain of Cthulhu's health gets, the less obvious the illusions become, to the point where they will look exactly like the real Brain of Cthulhu.

Defeating Queen Bee will allow theWitch Doctorto spawn; other than this, it does not advance the game in a major sense, though defeating it does provide some decent loot that can further help the player prepare for other boss battles, such as against theWall of Flesh. One such weapon is theBeenade, which is extremely effective when fighting the Wall of Flesh.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron strategies.
Skeletronis a large skeletal head with 4,400 /8,800/11,220health and two hands. It is initially summoned by speaking to theOld ManNPCat the entrance of theDungeonand activating his curse atnight, but can be summoned again by killing theClothierwhile equipped with theClothier Voodoo Dollat night.
Skeletron will alternate between attacking the player with its hands and performing a spinning attack. Its hands can be attacked and defeated to make the battle easier, although this is not required. If it has not been defeated before the night is over, Skeletron will spin at a high speed, dealing very large amounts of damage that usually kill the player in one hit, until either it is defeated or all players are dead.
InExpert Mode, Skeletron's head is more resistant to damage until its hands are destroyed. Once one hand is destroyed, it will start shooting homing skulls at the player. It is also much faster. Its hands inflict theSlowdebuff, and its head inflictsBleeding. If the player gets caught by its head-spin attack, Skeletron can ""stun-lock"" them, a lethal situation that can only be escaped by high mobility, e.g. with ahook.

For elaborate strategies on defeating Wall of Flesh, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Wall of Flesh strategies.
Wall of Fleshis a towering wall that spans the entire screen height. It has 8,000 /11,200/14,280health. It is summoned by throwing aGuide Voodoo Dollinto a pool oflavawhile theGuideis alive. Defeating it will irreversibly initiateHardmodein the world. It can drop several powerful items, one of them being the guaranteed dropPwnhammerwhich can be used to breakDemon AltarsorCrimson Altarsin order to spawn various game-advancingHardmode ores.
Upon summoning Wall of Flesh, the player will be afflicted with theHorrifieddebuff, which prevents fleeing from the battle – any attempt to do so will result in severe damage viaThe Tongueor instant death if the player tries to teleport away, and the debuff will not be removed until either the player or the Wall of Flesh is killed. Wall of Flesh will then sweep across the map, moving faster as its health gets lower. It must be killed before it reaches the end of the map, otherwise it will despawn and any living players in the Underworld will instantly die. Additionally, Wall of Flesh's eyes fire lasers, with the rate of fire increasing as it takes damage. Its mouth burpsLeechesthat will chase the player, and it has small mouths attached to it called The Hungry, which will also move toward and damage the player.
InExpert Mode, Wall of Flesh will greatly increase its movement speed as its health decreases, eventually surpassing even players riding theBunny Mountorhorse mountsin movement speed. The Hungry will rapidly respawn, thus seemingly blocking the wall from attacks, and can deal significant damage themselves. The faster Wall of Flesh moves and the quicker The Hungry respawn, the more the player will have to focus on dealing damage and moving across a decent terrain.
Hardmodebosses are significantly stronger than previous bosses.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Queen Slime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Queen Slime strategies.
Queen Slimeis a giant slime with 18,000 /28,800/36,720health. It is available to battle at the start of Hardmode, and is summoned fromGelatin Crystalsin theUnderground Hallow. It is an optional boss fight and is a small gap to challenge before facing themechanical bosses, warranting equipment upgrades and other items. There is a very strong resemblance to thepre-HardmodeKing Slime, and is one of two Hallowed bosses featured in the game.
As it takes damage it spawnsCrystal Slimes,Bouncy Slimes, andHeavenly Slimesto aid it.  While its first form is straightforward with attack patterns similar to that of King Slime's, the second form poses much more of a threat as the boss begins to fly in the air, shooting projectiles from above.
For elaborate strategies on defeating The Twins, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:The Twins strategies.
The Twinsare a pair of cyberneticEyes of Cthulhu. They exist as two individual entities, known asRetinazerandSpazmatism, with the former having 20,000 /30,000/38,250health and the latter having 23,000 /34,500/43,987health. The Twins are summoned using aMechanical Eyeat night. It is worth noting that they will gaindefensein their second forms, unlike the Eye of Cthulhu.
The two eyes have different fighting styles. Retinazer focuses on shooting the player with Death Lasers like theDestroyer'sProbes. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, replacing its pupil with a laser cannon. During this form, it will shoot lasers extremely fast, sometimes having the same fire rate as aMegashark.
The other eye, Spazmatism, focuses on slamming into the player and firing cursed flames. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, resembling a mechanical version of the Eye of Cthulhu's second form. It will deal a lot more damage, and the flames it shoots are more consistent like theFlamethrowerinstead of theCursed Flames, but the flames will still inflictCursed Infernodebuff on the player. The last Twin destroyed will drop all of the loot.
InExpert Mode, Retinazer will shoot lasers faster, and Spazmatism charges faster in its second form.

The Destroyeris a colossal mechanizedEater of Worldswith 80,000 /120,000/153,000health. It is considered the easiest Hardmode boss by many players, despite having the second-highest health.
The Destroyer is summoned by crafting and using aMechanical Wormanywhere, but can only be spawned at night.
Although it is similar to its pre-Hardmode counterpart, the Eater of Worlds, it has some key differences: it will not divide into smaller segments, will shoot lasers from its body if space is available, and will deployProbesto attack once a segment is destroyed.
The Destroyer will shoot Death Lasers, increasing in attack speed as it loses health. Weapons that deal damage to multiple segments likeFlails,Daedalus Stormbow, and theDemon Scytheare recommended, because they will hit multiple sections of The Destroyer at once.
InExpert Mode, The Destroyer's head can deal damage as high as280/420, crippling the player if they are hit head-on.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron Prime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron Prime strategies.
Skeletron Primeis a weaponized mechanical variation ofSkeletron, with the head alone having 28,000 /42,000/53,550health. Instead of two hands, it has four limbs – a vice, laser gun, saw, and cannon. With the head and all limbs combined, Skeletron Prime has 59,000 /88,500/112,836health.
Skeletron Prime can be summoned by using aMechanical Skullat night.
Like Skeletron, only the head has to be defeated. It is more mobile than its predecessor, and it regularly flies off-screen, making targeting more difficult.

For example, most bosses have associatedsummoning itemsthat can be used to spawn them manually under certain conditions, while there are others that will appear after the player interacts in a certain way with the environment.Eventbosses will only appear during their respective events and leave when the event ends. Mini-bosses also exist and appear only during special events, expressing the same amount of difficulty as many normal bosses. Their health has a huge range: On Classic Mode it ranges from 1,000 to 273,000.

This is most prevalent when fightingThe Twins.)
All enemies that can spawn naturally have a better chance of spawning if the player stands near a placedWater Candleor while under the effects of aBattle Potion.
These are the first bosses the player can encounter. Usually, defeating one of these bosses will give the player items and materials necessary to progress in the game, eventually leading toHardmode. Although there are 8pre-Hardmodebosses, only 7 can be spawned in the same world, asEater of Worldsis exclusive to worlds containingthe Corruption, andBrain of Cthulhuis exclusive to worlds containingthe Crimson(assuming the player does not place an alternate evil in the same world as the other one, e.g. via seeds from another world orseeds purchased from theDryadNPC in Hardmode, and does not use aDrunk world seed).

To defeat it, every section must be brought down to less than two body parts to be killed (the smallest possible section is a head and a tail with no body pieces). Due to how helpful Corruption gear is, this will probably be the second boss faced in worlds that have Corruption, rather than those who haveCrimson.
The Eater of Worlds is extremely vulnerable to piercing and true melee due to the fact that all body parts take damage seperately, so it is recommended to use a bow (Platinum/Gold, or Demon Bow if you are willing to farm the small natural Demonite patches in Corruption worlds) along with Unholy arrows for piercing, and Jester arrows for even more piercing if you have them.
Eater of Worlds is the only source ofShadow Scalesin the game, and it drops large amounts ofDemonite Ore. The Demonite Ore can be sold for almost10per 99, making this technically the best pre-Hardmode boss for farming in the game.

Defeating Queen Bee will allow theWitch Doctorto spawn; other than this, it does not advance the game in a major sense, though defeating it does provide some decent loot that can further help the player prepare for other boss battles, such as against theWall of Flesh. One such weapon is theBeenade, which is extremely effective when fighting the Wall of Flesh.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron strategies.

Skeletron will alternate between attacking the player with its hands and performing a spinning attack. Its hands can be attacked and defeated to make the battle easier, although this is not required. If it has not been defeated before the night is over, Skeletron will spin at a high speed, dealing very large amounts of damage that usually kill the player in one hit, until either it is defeated or all players are dead.
InExpert Mode, Skeletron's head is more resistant to damage until its hands are destroyed. Once one hand is destroyed, it will start shooting homing skulls at the player. It is also much faster. Its hands inflict theSlowdebuff, and its head inflictsBleeding. If the player gets caught by its head-spin attack, Skeletron can ""stun-lock"" them, a lethal situation that can only be escaped by high mobility, e.g. with ahook.

Defeating it will irreversibly initiateHardmodein the world. It can drop several powerful items, one of them being the guaranteed dropPwnhammerwhich can be used to breakDemon AltarsorCrimson Altarsin order to spawn various game-advancingHardmode ores.
Upon summoning Wall of Flesh, the player will be afflicted with theHorrifieddebuff, which prevents fleeing from the battle – any attempt to do so will result in severe damage viaThe Tongueor instant death if the player tries to teleport away, and the debuff will not be removed until either the player or the Wall of Flesh is killed. Wall of Flesh will then sweep across the map, moving faster as its health gets lower.

Additionally, Wall of Flesh's eyes fire lasers, with the rate of fire increasing as it takes damage. Its mouth burpsLeechesthat will chase the player, and it has small mouths attached to it called The Hungry, which will also move toward and damage the player.
InExpert Mode, Wall of Flesh will greatly increase its movement speed as its health decreases, eventually surpassing even players riding theBunny Mountorhorse mountsin movement speed. The Hungry will rapidly respawn, thus seemingly blocking the wall from attacks, and can deal significant damage themselves. The faster Wall of Flesh moves and the quicker The Hungry respawn, the more the player will have to focus on dealing damage and moving across a decent terrain.
Hardmodebosses are significantly stronger than previous bosses.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Queen Slime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Queen Slime strategies.

As it takes damage it spawnsCrystal Slimes,Bouncy Slimes, andHeavenly Slimesto aid it.  While its first form is straightforward with attack patterns similar to that of King Slime's, the second form poses much more of a threat as the boss begins to fly in the air, shooting projectiles from above.
For elaborate strategies on defeating The Twins, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:The Twins strategies.
The Twinsare a pair of cyberneticEyes of Cthulhu. They exist as two individual entities, known asRetinazerandSpazmatism, with the former having 20,000 /30,000/38,250health and the latter having 23,000 /34,500/43,987health. The Twins are summoned using aMechanical Eyeat night. It is worth noting that they will gaindefensein their second forms, unlike the Eye of Cthulhu.
The two eyes have different fighting styles. Retinazer focuses on shooting the player with Death Lasers like theDestroyer'sProbes. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, replacing its pupil with a laser cannon. During this form, it will shoot lasers extremely fast, sometimes having the same fire rate as aMegashark.
The other eye, Spazmatism, focuses on slamming into the player and firing cursed flames. Once it reaches 40% health, it will transform into its second form, resembling a mechanical version of the Eye of Cthulhu's second form. It will deal a lot more damage, and the flames it shoots are more consistent like theFlamethrowerinstead of theCursed Flames, but the flames will still inflictCursed Infernodebuff on the player. The last Twin destroyed will drop all of the loot.
InExpert Mode, Retinazer will shoot lasers faster, and Spazmatism charges faster in its second form.

The Destroyer is summoned by crafting and using aMechanical Wormanywhere, but can only be spawned at night.
Although it is similar to its pre-Hardmode counterpart, the Eater of Worlds, it has some key differences: it will not divide into smaller segments, will shoot lasers from its body if space is available, and will deployProbesto attack once a segment is destroyed.
The Destroyer will shoot Death Lasers, increasing in attack speed as it loses health. Weapons that deal damage to multiple segments likeFlails,Daedalus Stormbow, and theDemon Scytheare recommended, because they will hit multiple sections of The Destroyer at once.
InExpert Mode, The Destroyer's head can deal damage as high as280/420, crippling the player if they are hit head-on.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Skeletron Prime, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Skeletron Prime strategies.
Skeletron Primeis a weaponized mechanical variation ofSkeletron, with the head alone having 28,000 /42,000/53,550health. Instead of two hands, it has four limbs – a vice, laser gun, saw, and cannon. With the head and all limbs combined, Skeletron Prime has 59,000 /88,500/112,836health.
Skeletron Prime can be summoned by using aMechanical Skullat night.
Like Skeletron, only the head has to be defeated. It is more mobile than its predecessor, and it regularly flies off-screen, making targeting more difficult. It is also worth noting that when its head spins, itsdefensedoubles from 24 to 48, unlike Skeletron, whose defense is dropped to 0 when spinning.
Skeletron Prime will dropHallowed BarsandSouls of Frightupon being defeated, which are both used to craft many kinds of armor and tools. Like Skeletron, if Prime is not killed before the night ends, it will spin and target the player, generally killing the player in one hit, and will despawn afterwards.
InExpert Mode, Skeletron Prime moves significantly faster during its spinning attack, similarly toSkeletron.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Mechdusa, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Mechdusa strategies.
TheMechdusais an amalgamation of the 3Mechanical bosseswith 273000 /348073/530073health.
It can only be summoned with theOcram's Razoron the ""Everything"" akaGet fixed boiWorld seed.
Mechdusa serves as an alternate fight route for the Mechanical Bosses, as the bosses cannot be fought separately on Everything-seeded worlds, instead forcing you to fight them all at once as Mechdusa. While it does not drop a trophy exclusive to that boss, there will be a chance that it drops the trophies of all four of its constituent bosses.
Despite not being the final boss of the game, Mechdusa has the highest health for any single boss. Even in Classic Mode, Mechdusa tops the Moon Lord's 
with roughly twice the amount of health.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Plantera, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Plantera strategies.
Planterais an enormous flower with 30,000 /42,000/53,549health. It is spawned by destroying aPlantera's Bulb, which is found in theUnderground Jungleafter defeating all threemechanical bosses. If the player exits the Underground Jungle, Plantera becomes ""enraged"", gaining a significant boost to its stats.
Plantera has two forms. In its first form, it clings to solidblocksusing vine-like hooks and fires Seeds (and eventually Poison Seeds). In its second form, Plantera has increased speed and moves more aggressively towards the player. It will also release numerous Plantera's Tentacle minions that are attached to the main body.
InExpert Mode, the seeds can go through walls and have slight homing, and extra Plantera's Tentacles are attached to each hook (3 on each) in its second form, adding up to approximately 9 tendrils.
Once Plantera is defeated, theDungeonwill automatically spawn stronger Hardmodeenemies, such as thePaladin, and more varieties of loot can be dropped. Additionally, the spread of Crimson, Corruption and Hallow is slowed to half the speed it was Pre-Plantera fight.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Golem, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Golem strategies.
Golemis a large boss with a combined total of 60,000 /90,000/114,749health. It is summoned by using aLihzahrd Power Cellat theLihzahrd Altarin theJungle Temple. In order to access the Jungle Temple, Plantera must be defeated to obtain theTemple Key.

Once the head's health is depleted, it begins flying above the body while shooting fireballs and eye beams, leaving the body open to attack. The body will jump around and punch madly in this form. Defeating the body will defeat Golem.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Duke Fishron, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Duke Fishron strategies.
Duke Fishronis a mutant shark-pig-dragon hybrid with 60,000 /78,000/99,450health. It is summoned when aTruffle Wormis used asbaitfor fishing in theOcean.
In its first form, Duke Fishron will attempt to ram the player five times before either firing explosive bubbles or summoning Sharknados. In its second form, Duke Fishron gains glowing eyes and a boost to attack and defense. Although its ramming attacks remain the same, instead of shooting bubbles directly at the player, it flies quickly around in circles, sending bubbles everywhere. Instead of summoning Sharknados in this form, Duke Fishron summons larger Cthulhunados. These remain in place until Duke Fishron is defeated.
InExpert Mode, when Duke Fishron drops below 15% (11700/14917) health, it enters its third form. In this form, the screen turns dark, Duke Fishron becomes invisible, and only its glowing eyes are visible. It teleports and tries to ram the player with high speed a few times, before it teleports again.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Empress of Light, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Empress of Light strategies.

This boss is meant to be a small gap in betweenPlanteraandGolem, but can be fought later or skipped altogether, as it is an optional fight.
If the player fights it the moment it is available, they will face a major difficulty spike and numerous attack patterns. This boss can also be fought in the day, which will make it ""enraged"", greatly increasing its attack damage to an instant-kill, but will drop theTerraprismaonce 100% of damage is dealt during the day.

Lunatic Cultist's attacks become more powerful as it loses health. The Lunatic Cultist flies around randomly, cycling between shooting fireballs, creating a ball which shoots lightning at the player, shooting a giant snowflake which shoots ice shards around it, shooting shadowflames, and shooting five destructible projectiles twice in a row. The Lunatic Cultist will also create fake copies of itself, which will summon aPhantasm Dragonwhen damaged. If a Phantasm Dragon is still alive and the player damages these copies, it will summon anAncient Visioninstead. Waiting too long to attack the real Lunatic Cultist will also cause thePhantasm DragonorAncient Visionto be summoned.
InExpert Mode, the Lunatic Cultist will spawnAncient Doomsalong with its other attacks.
For elaborate strategies on defeating Moon Lord, includingweaponandarenarecommendations, seeGuide:Moon Lord strategies.
Moon Lordis the final boss ofTerraria, and drops a majority of the endgame items, such as theMeowmere. It also dropsLuminite, anoreused to craft many endgamearmorsets andtools. It is summoned by defeating all four of theCelestial Pillarsfrom theLunar Events, or by using aCelestial Sigil. It has a combined health of 145,000 /217,500/277,311, the second most health of any boss in the game.
Moon Lord has two hands and a head which must be killed by attacking the eyes on them, and when killed will release invincibleTrue Eyes of Cthulhu. When the three eyes are destroyed, the Moon Lord's core opens up on its chest, which must then be destroyed to defeat the boss.
Moon Lord's hands shoot two projectiles at once which home onto the player, and summon phantom versions of True Eye of Cthulhu and throwing them at the player. Moon Lord's top eye will occasionally fire a Phantasmal Deathray that will sweep across the entire screen. Being very deadly to players, it can be avoided by hiding under solidblocks(it will pass through blocks on thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderversions), or by trying to escape its wrath on a flyingmount. When the True Eyes of Cthulhu are released, the places where they used to be will inflict minor contact damage. The True Eyes of Cthulhu will fire less damaging versions of many of the same attacks as they did when they were still enclosed within the Moon Lord.
InExpert Mode, Moon Lord's Phantasmal Deathray attack deals a lot more damage, enough to kill most players in one hit.
Eventbosses are classified asmini-bosses, except for theCelestial Pillars.

Buffs,"Buffsare positive status effects granted to a player upon consuming, equipping, or otherwise activating various items. Active buffs are shown as icons below thehotbar, along with their remaining duration. Buffs are almost universally positive or at least benign effects, in contrast withDebuffs, over which the player has much less control.
Buffs can be easily activated with the buffhotkey(defaultBon PC), which activates all the buff-granting consumables in the player's inventory (starting from the top-left) that are not currently activated. A player is limited to 22 (44 as of the 1.4.4 update ) (10) active buffs and debuffs at any one point, and the leftmost buff in the bar will be deactivated if another is applied after this limit is reached. Most Buffs can be deactivated prematurely by right-clicking their icon, though those that are granted by proximity to an item will only deactivate when the player is no longer in range (seeEnvironmentalbelow).
Activated buffs are bound to a character, and persist as that character moves from server to server and from world to world. With the exception of those granted byFlasks, buffs are always deactivated on the player'sdeath, though even Flasks are terminated along with the player in theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version, andNintendo3DSversion.
These buffs are provided from sources and consumed upon use, such as potions, flasks, and food.
These buffs are provided naturally by equipment, either permanently or under certain circumstances.
These buffs are provided upon right-clicking particular placed furniture.
These buffs are provided by being in range of particular placed furniture, blocks, or NPCs.Banners, as well as static effects from objects like Peace Candle and Happy!, have a 170×125/ 100×84tile area of effect centered on the object. Since they cannot be canceled by right clicking them, the only way to remove the buff is to leave the area (with the exception of honey).
Aside from the normal buffs, some buffs provide you with aminion. Unlike other buffs, they last until the player dies, cancels the buff, or leaves the current world."
Cavern,"Map view highlighting the Cavern layer range

His clothes are no longer tattered, his eyes have turned blue (from red), and he is wearing aRed Hat.
Equipping theClothier Voodoo Dollallows a player to attack and kill the Clothier (similar to theGuide Voodoo Doll). Doing so atnightre-summons Skeletron. Killing him with theFlymealwill not summon Skeletron however.

Coins,"Want me to pull a coin from behind your ear? No? Ok.
—The Wizard
Coinsare the main unit of currency inTerraria. They are primarily used forNPCtransactions, but can also be used asammunitionfor theCoin Gun. Terraria's currency is made of four different metals making four types of coins:Copper Coins,Silver Coins,Gold Coins, andPlatinum Coins.
Coins can be obtained by killingenemies, interacting with NPCs, finding them in multiple forms of loot, orshaking trees. Despite coins appearing as the materials ""Copper"", ""Silver"", ""Gold"", or ""Platinum"", they are not related to their respectiveoretypes and cannot be crafted from them.
The coin value an enemy drops upon death is calculated from fixed values in the game code, with some random variation. SeeNPC drops § Coin dropsfor further information.
Inside the player's inventory, coins have their own special slots, although it is possible to move them into normal inventory slots."

"
Crafting,"Craftingis the process of combiningmaterials(""ingredients"") into new items. It is one of the primary means of creating new weapons and tools and is thus generally indispensable for game progress. The entirety of an item's ingredients is called itsrecipe.
Crafting is done through the crafting bar, visible on the left side of the interface below the player'sinventory, which presents all craftable items available to the player. Items will only appear in this list if the player has the ingredients in their inventory. Pressing the⚒Use / Attackbutton on an item in the list will consume its required ingredients and place the item on the cursor, from which it can be placed in the inventory. Holding the⚷Interactbutton to craft a stackable item will begin to repeatedly produce the item until the stack is filled. Crafting takes no time, though there is a very small delay between the creation of items in a stack. The longer the button is held, the shorter this delay.
While many items can be crafted using only the materials in their recipes, most will require acrafting stationto make their recipe available. Items that require a station will appear in the crafting bar while the player stands near the required item, requiring no interaction with the station. In this way, a player may craft from multiple nearby stations at once."
Crafting_stations,"ACrafting Stationallows players to craft various items. Entering theinventoryscreen displays the ""Crafting window"" in the lower-left, and when the player is standing near one or more Crafting Stations and possesses the right crafting ingredients, the bar is expanded with additional item choices.
Nearly all crafting stations arefurniture. There are currently 44 crafting stations in total.
These have limited crafting use and only craft a couple of arguably non-essential items.
The following crafting stations are used to craft themed versions of various furniture items.
Some items requireLiquidsto craft. Standing next to anySinktype works if the required liquid is water.
Liquids also produce unique blocks when colliding with each other (+=Obsidian,+=Honey Block,+=Crispy Honey Block,//+=Aetherium Block.)
These do not use the crafting menu but produce items in unique ways.
This list shows the general order a new player will likely need to follow in obtaining thebasiccrafting stations. This list only covers stations for essential tools and game advancement. Others can be obtained in more varying orders."
Critical_hit,"Critical hitsoccur randomly when strikingenemies. By default, each successful hit on an enemy has a 4% chance of being a ""critical hit"", dealing approximately double the usual damage of the weapon in use with 40% moreknockback. A small number of weapons have a base critical strike chance that is higher than the default 4%. In addition, certainmodifiers,armorbonuses,accessories, andbuffscan boost the player's effective critical strike chance.

Damage,"Damageis the number ofhealthpoints subtracted from an entity's current health. It can be inflicted by a multitude of entities, most prominentlyweapons,enemies, andNPCs(and all related projectiles). Furthermore, it can be caused by environmental hazards (such asthorny bushes,traps, orlava) andgame mechanics(such asfall damage,drowning, ordebuffs). Damage can generally only be inflicted on entities with a health statistic, i.e.,players, most enemies, and NPCs. Most damage sources additionally inflictknockbackon the damaged entity.
When an entity receives damage, several calculations increasing or decreasing the amount of damage (depending on several factors; seebelow) are performed before the actual damage is applied to the entity. Therefore, the damage statistic of any damaging entity is usually only theaveragedamage it inflicts. Most hits' damage deviates from this average number.
Damage inflicted by player-wielded weapons is categorized into four different types:melee,ranged,magic, andsummon.Accessories,buffs, and other damage-boosting or damage-decreasing effects often only affect one of these damage types. A few weapons as well as all other damaging entities are not categorized into any of the four types.
Melee weaponsare used in close- to medium-ranged combat. Their defining trait is the fact that they do not consumeammunitionormanaupon use. They are roughly categorized intoswords,spears,flails,boomerangs, andyoyos. There are several other melee weapons not fitting any of these types.
In total, there are currently 190 unique melee weapons.
Ranged weaponsare used in long-ranged combat. Their defining trait is the requirement ofammunitionin order for the weapon to operate. They are roughly categorized intobows,repeaters,guns, andlaunchers. Althoughboomerangsare thrown,Terrariaclassifies them as melee weapons. In thePC version,Console version,Old-gen console version,Mobile version,Windows Phone version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader version, allconsumableweapons are classified ranged weapons. However, in theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, they are classified asthrowing weapons.
In total, there are currently 115 unique ranged weapons.
Magic weaponsare used in medium- to long-ranged combat. Their defining trait is the consumption ofmanaupon every use. Due to their unusual and unique forms of attack, the majority of magic weapons can hardly be categorized into distinct types.
In total, there are currently 77 unique magic weapons.
Summoning weaponsinclude summon staffs andwhips. Using a summon staff spawns a secondary character which will aid the player in battle by automatically attacking enemies. The summoned character is either mobile, i.e. following the player around (minion), or stationary, i.e. remaining at the location it was summoned at (sentry). Whips are close- to mid-range weapons which boost minion damage on hit enemies as well as marking them, making minions focus on those enemies.
Mountsthat do damage, like theSlime Mount, deal summon damage.
In total, there are currently 47 unique summon weapons, 9 of which are whips.
After being damaged, the player gets a period of time called an ""invincibility frame"" during which they cannot be damaged again. By default this is 2/3 of a second (40 ticks[1]), but various equipment can extend this:
Enemies get a similar but more limited effect from ""piercing"" and continuous attacks: Any damage source that can strike an enemy, and then remain able to cause damage afterwards.
After being struck by such an attack, the enemy cannot take damage from another such attack for a brief period, usually 1/6 of a second (10 ticks[1]). Thus, when inlavaor when pierced by a persistent weapon such as aVilethorn, they can take damage at most 6 times a second. However, for multi-segmented enemies (usuallyworm types), this resistance applies to each segment separately, so such attacks can still strike multiple segments of a single enemy. (Note that worm-type enemies are immune to lava in any case.)
On theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionVerify, this also applies to almost any missile, beam, or other projectile that continues to exist after striking an enemy. This can sharply limit the effects of other piercing weapons used against the same target, as well as weapons that fire multiple piercing projectiles such as thePoison Staff. Mostminionsare considered to have piercing attacks, which can also hinder the efficiency of piercing weapons used alongside them. This problem is remarkably present with theSpider Staffand theStardust Dragon Staff.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, summons do not hinder other piercing weapons, but piercing weapons may still hinder the effectiveness of summons.
A few advanced weapons have special behavior:
The damage that a player-wieldedweapondeals upon hit is determined cumulatively:
For example,GodlyDao of PowwithTurtle Armor,MenacingWarrior Emblem, MenacingAvenger Emblem, MenacingDestroyer Emblem, MenacingMechanical Gloveand MenacingCelestial Stoneequipped,Well Fedactive:
step1 = 63 × (1 + 14/100) = 71.82
step2 = round(71.82) = 72
step3 = 72 × [1 + (6+8+0+0)/100 + (15+12+10+12+10+4+4+4+4+4)/100 + (5)/100] = 72 × [1.98] = 142.56
WeaponDamage = ⌊142.56⌋ = 142
Careful: Only use the modifiers which have an influence on the specific weapon (e.g. don't use magic damage bonus for a melee weapon).
Damage done to an enemy is depending on the enemies defense and whether there is a relatedbannernearby.
So,
Damage dealt is always at least 1.
In addition the outgoing damage is modified by a random factor, 0.85~1.15, (but some types of damage, like theSlime Mount, will not be affected by this). The damage is rounded to the nearest whole number. So you can compute the minimal and maximal damage dealt to an enemy with your weapon:
At critical hits you are dealing double damage"
Day_and_night_cycle,"Picture showing: Moonrise, Midnight, Moonset and Sunrise, Midday, Sunset.
You should stay indoors at night. It is very dangerous to be wandering around in the dark.
—The Guide
Theday and night cycleof theTerrariaworld refers to the rising and setting of the Sun andMoon, and the ways this can affect the world.
Note that the sun in Terraria rises at the left of the map, even though the left is referred to in-game as ""West"" (the same for right/East), e.g. when aGoblin Army,Frost Legion, orPirate Invasionbegins approaching.
At thesurfacelayer, unique enemies spawn at night. Nocturnal enemies will run or fly away when day starts.
Additionally,Eye of Cthulhu,Skeletron,The Twins,The Destroyer,Skeletron PrimeandOcramcan only be summoned at night, and will flee or become nigh-unkillable at dawn. In contrast,King Slimecan only spawn randomly during the day, though it can be summoned with theSlime Crownat any time.
The following enemies only spawn during the night:
Naturally, all enemies exclusive to aBlood Moonalso only spawn at night."

—The Demolitionist
Deathoccurs when a player'shealthreaches zero. A death message is displayed dependent on how the player died. For example,""<Player name> tried to swim in lava.""is one that is displayed if the player died fromlavadamage.
When a player dies, their character will burst into pieces and aTombstoneis dropped at the location of their death. When the tombstone finds a suitable space, it will become a 2×2 tile. It stores text, much in the way theSignfunctions, with the player'sdeath message,and the real-world date. Being affected by physics, a Tombstone will fall after the player's death if they were moving at the time. If there is no flat 2-block space for a Tombstone, it will get stuck before it despawns.
If the player holds more than10when they die, the spawned Tombstone will be one of the five following golden Tombstones:
Upon death, a large red text saying""You were slain...""will be displayed on the center of the screen.The amount of droppedcoinswill be shown underneath,and a timer will display showing how long until the player respawns.
Death may occur from:
AClassic(Softcore) character will drop half, three-quarters (Expert Mode), or all (Master Mode) of each stack ofcoinsa player iscarryingat the moment of death in eachinventoryslot (always rounded up).[1]Coins stored instorage itemsare not affected.
AMediumcorecharacter will drop all carried items, including money andammo. Maximumhealthandmanawill be kept, and will not be reduced back to the default.
AHardcorecharacter will also drop all carried items. Furthermore, the character is permanently deleted upon death and the player turns into aghost, unable to interact with the environment, but still able to observe, move about, and chat with other players.
PvPdeath messages will use the default death messages from above, but will additionally state the name of the player's murderer along with theweaponor projectile with which the killing blow was landed.
Example:
Enemydeath messages work like PvP death messages.

Once a debuff has been inflicted, the debuff's icon will display to theupper right /upper left of the player's window, along with aicon shading /count-down timer, showing how much longer the debuff will be in effect.The counter will begin at one minute/second less than its listed duration and show zero during the final minute/second.
Most debuffs can only be inflicted byenemies, however it is also possible fortrapsandRed Potionto inflict some debuffs on players.
Players can inflict various debuffs on most enemies. SeeNotesfor a list of weapons that inflict debuffs on enemies.
In general, damaging debuffs will stack: If a player is bothPoisonedandOn Fire!, they will take damage from both debuffs. However, Poisoned andVenomdo not stack, and Poisoned will take precedence over Venom. Death always cancels any active buffs or debuffs.
Unlike buffs, debuffs cannot be canceled by right-clicking their icons. TheNursecan cancel debuffs at a cost of750per active debuff. This does not apply to thePotion Sicknessdebuff, because when trying to cancel the Potion Sickness debuff, the Nurse will not charge for recovery of the debuff and the debuff will not be canceled, but the Potion Sickness icon will disappear."

Defense,"Defenseis a statistic that determines the decrease indamagetaken per hit. Theplayer's defense can be increased by wearingarmorandaccessories, and temporarily boosted by variousbuffs, tile entities, and permanent upgrades. Damage taken by players is reduced by half /75*3/4 (75%)/100%of their defense, rounded down.Enemiesalso have a defense statistic.
No hit can be reduced below 1 damage, regardless of defense (with the exception of a player whosemultiplayerally is wearing aPaladin's Shield).
Some forms of damage are impossible to reduce through defense, e.g. damage from health-drainingdebuffslikeCursed Infernoor fromdrowninginwater. Damage taken fromlava, however, can be reduced through defense.
Defense gives a flat reduction in damage, i.e. damage is reduced by a fixed amount per hit (as opposed to a multiplicative damage reduction, which would reduce damage by a percentage). It is calculated after the general ±15% damage randomization.
The formula is:net dmg = ⌊attack dmg - def × factor⌋, wherefactoris0.5inClassic Mode,0.75inExpert Mode, and1inMaster Mode.[1]
Enemies have a defense statistic just like players do, but they do not gain more protection from defense in Expert Mode or Master Mode. They will always reduce incoming damage by 50% of their defense:net dmg = ⌊attack dmg - def × 0.5⌋.
Critical hits against enemies will double the net damage value. In other words, the crit damage multiplier is taken into accountafterthe attack's damage has already been reduced by defense.
A player's defense score can be increased by equippingarmorandaccessories. Armor usually consists of three items, granting an additional bonus if all pieces match, the set bonus, which may increase the defense score further. Some accessories grant direct defense boosts (see the following table), but all accessories can also bereforgedto a maximum of +4 defense per accessory.
Seearmorfor detailed defense information about every piece of armor.
Buffsanddebuffscan temporarily alter a player's or an enemy's defense. Currently, there is no buff increasing enemies' defense. A player's defense cannot be reduced to fall below 0.
Armor penetrationis a hidden player statistic that determines the amount of the enemy's defense portion that is ignored when dealing damage to it. For instance, aPixienormally has 20 defense. If the player has the Shark Tooth/Stinger Necklace equipped, then the Pixie will be taken to have 15 defense instead.
The following items grant armor penetration:
In addition, the projectiles of certain weapons and accessories have their own armor penetration stat, which is added to the player's armor penetration when inflicting damage upon an enemy with them:[2]
The highest possible defense can be attained using the setups described in the following sections.
OnPC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, the maximum possible defense is 186 /196/204, while onOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is 181 /191/199. The setups are the same:

Demolitionist,"TheDemolitionistis anNPCvendor that will spawn once the following criteria have been met:
If the Demolitionist is killed, he will only respawn if the above conditions are met again. This means an explosive must be placed in the player's inventory again. Having explosives stored inchestsor other containers will also fulfill the requirement.

Desert,"
The heat distortion effect added in1.3.3
TheDesertis asandybiome. Each map will generally contain at least one Desert area. The main Desert, present in every world, will be larger and will house theUnderground Desertbiome beneath.Pyramidscan rarely appear in Desert biomes. Pools ofwatermay rarely appear in the desert, which take on a sandy yellow (onOld ChineseandtModLoader Legacy) or turquoise (onPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader) color.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, theOasismini biomecan be found inside the Desert, which includes palm trees and a big pool of water in the middle.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, the main desert has a33.33*1/3 (33.33%)chance of containing some kind of entrance to the Underground Desert below. These entrances come in four varieties: Chambers, Anthill, Larva Hole, and Pit.[1]If spawning this way, some of the Anthills or Larva Holes may just containAntlion Eggsand not lead to the Underground Desert. On theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the main desert will always have an Pit-type entrance.
An area is considered a Desert biome if there at least 1500 Sand Blocks[2], causing the water and background to change, but Desert plants and enemies can spawn on even a single block of sand. Deserts are overridden by most other biomes, including theOcean.Rainwill occur in Deserts just as in any other surface biome. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionofTerraria,Sandstormsmay also occur periodically/when wind speed is over 30 mph, which cause special enemies to spawn as well as pushing the player according to the direction of thewind.
DuringHardmode, the increased spread ofthe Corruption/CrimsonandHallowis likely to eventually convert any normal Deserts. Corruption/Crimson Deserts spawned upon world creation may also be turned into Hallow ones if they are inside the world part that is instantly converted at the beginning of Hardmode. All variations will be similar to their main biomes (e.g. The Corruption or The Hallow): themusictheme is the same, theenemiesare the same (except forMummyvariants and sandstorm enemies), and the background is just slightly different. The sand will be replaced byebonsand,crimsand, orpearlsand. Although their color will change, cacti still dropCactuswhen cut, andWaterleafare also able to grow in a Hallowed Desert.

Desktop_version_history,"TheDesktop versionorPC versionofTerrariarefers to the Windows, macOS, and Linux PC versions. These versions are produced entirely byRe-Logic,Terraria'soriginal developer (whereas the currentConsoleversion is being worked upon by DR Studios, a third-party developer). Because of this, updates always come to the Desktop version first.
Note thatDesktop versionon this wiki only refers to the vanilla Desktop version, andtModLoaderis used to refer to the current stable release version of tModLoader (currently ).
All three desktop versions are on the same update path and are updated together, sharing a common version number, though each has its own installation package. All can be purchased/downloaded throughSteamorGOG.com.
macOS and Linux versions became available starting with version1.3.0.7as a beta test package on July 23, 2015, and in1.3.0.8as a full release on August 12, 2015. All prior versions were Windows only.
"
Difficulty,"Difficultyrefers to how challenging the gameplay is.Terrariahas different forms of difficulty for both characters and worlds.
Journey Mode is unique, as the player may choose and change game difficulty whenever they wish. Journey Mode also includes additional tools such as godmode, item duplication, time and weather control, and the ability to control enemy spawns. The player must choose Journey on both the character and world creation menus to utilize it.
Classic (or Softcore) is the default character mode (the only one onWindows Phoneand3DS), and is generally considered the easiest. It is the standard Terraria experience.
Classic characters drop half (3/4) (all) of theircoinswhen they die, which can be retrieved upon respawning, but may also be collected by other players inmultiplayeror byenemiesinExpert Mode. Classic characters respawn at theirspawn point, 7 / 15 (15 / 30) seconds after death on singleplayer / multiplayer, respectively.
Mediumcore characters drop all of their items upon death, including all coins andammo. These can be retrieved upon respawning, but any items may also be collected by other players in multiplayer and coins by enemies in Expert and Master Mode. Mediumcore characters still respawn at their spawn point, 7 / 15 (15 / 30) seconds after death on singleplayer / multiplayer, respectively.
There is no reward for playing in Mediumcore, other than increased difficulty for its own sake.
The natural comparison here is toMinecraft, where this is the default behavior ondeath. There are, however, significant differences:
Hardcore characters die permanently, and drop all of their items upon death, including coins and ammo, which other players can then collect in multiplayer.
Death causes a Hardcore character to become aGhostthat can continue to observe the world but cannot affect it. Ghosts can fly, pass through walls, and continue to chat with othermultiplayerusers, but cannot interact with the environment in most ways and cannot open a world.
Once a dead Hardcore character quits the current world, that character is permanently deleted. The items players placed inChestswill not be deleted, but items the character had inportable storagewill be deleted.
NPCs in worlds with Hardcore characters in them will dropTombstones, which can potentially result in aGraveyardbiome."

TheDryadis anNPCvendor that will spawn once the following criteria have been met:
In addition to selling items, the Dryad can also report the percentages ofCorruption/CrimsonandHallowthat exist in the current world.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, whenenemiesare nearby, the Dryad will periodically grant theDryad's Blessingbuffto players and other town NPCs in the vicinity and displays a leaf barrier effect. The buff grants +8defenseto players and +6 /+10/+14defense to town NPCs, increased health regeneration, and gives the player (and town NPCs) aThorns effect. Enemies within the leaf barrier and with clear sight to the Dryad will be inflicted with theDryad's Banedebuff, which will deal 4+ damage per second (plus various progression-baseddamage boosts, and all multiplied by 1× /1.5×/1.75×); the minimum damage dealt by the Dryad's Bane debuff is 4 /6/7per second.

The Dryad's reports on Corruption/Crimson/Hallow coverage are accompanied by a status message. She sees Hallow as ""good"", and Corruption or Crimson as ""bad"". The Dryad makes the distinction between Corruption and Crimson if they are present in the same world, and will list their percentages separately, though they both contribute to the overall ""bad"" total in her final report. The status report is not updated live.VerifyThis is presumably to reduce the slowdowns that could be caused by constantly searching through the millions of blocks in a Terraria world. The report can be manually updated by leaving and re-joining the world.

Duke_Fishron,"Duke Fishronis aHardmodeboss. While he can be summoned as soon as Hardmode is initiated, he can pose a serious threat to new or underprepared players and should be fought later on in the game. Some players may challenge him with post-mechanical bossesgear, but most players may want to wait until post-Golemto battle him. Fighting Duke Fishron is completely optional and not required forgame progression, but his defeat will reward the player with powerful weapons.

The Truffle Worm is a rarecritterthat must be caught with theBug Net,Golden Bug Net, orLavaproof Bug Netin an undergroundGlowing Mushroom biome. Once the bobber bobs, reeling in the line spawns Duke Fishron, who emerges from the water, pauses for a moment, and then begins attacking the player.
Summoning Duke Fishron does not require that any other bosses have been defeated beforehand, so on a technical level, he is only restricted by theHardmodeexclusiveTruffle Worm, which can be used to spawn him in any world. If within the Ocean biome, he can also be summoned by fishing in lava or honey. The player's Fishing Power is irrelevant to the summoning, and Crate or Sonar potions will be wasted.
When hitting the player in Expert Mode or Master Mode, Duke Fishron has a 33% chance to inflictBleedingand  a 33% chance to inflictFeral Bite.Bleedingcan be ignored with anAdhesive Bandageor any of its upgrades, and all of Feral Bite's side effects will be prevented by theAnkh CharmorAnkh Shield.
Duke Fishron lunges at the player exactly five times, traveling through blocks, before using one of two projectile attacks in this order:
When Duke Fishron falls below 50% (30000 /39000/49500) health, he remains stationary for a second and transforms, being a good time to deal damage and/or consumePotions. His skin becomes a darker green and his eyes will start glowing. His damage and speed increase significantly, but his defense is reduced to 40. His lunges become faster, and are only performed three times instead of five before executing one of his projectile attacks, which are also upgraded:
When Duke Fishron falls below 15% (11700/14850) health, he will stop moving to transform again, and the background will be covered in a dark, blue fog. Duke Fishron will become invisible, but his eyes still glow. His damage will be reduced to184/277, his defense will drop all the way to0, and he will only attack by charging at the player, but he gains the ability to teleport behind them before doing so.
His charges will come in a set pattern:
After being defeated, the background will return to normal, and hisTreasure Bagwill be dropped.

TheDungeonis a vast underground labyrinth made ofBricksthat is generated on world creation, being located on either the far right or left of the map, and contains uniqueenemieswhose spawn rates increase the deeper a player travels. It begins at an above-ground entrance structure resembling a castle, and extends down to near-Underworlddepths. One Dungeon is generated in each world, appearing in one of threeDungeon Brickcolors, and with one or moreDungeon Brick Wallpatterns. Accessing the Dungeon below 0' requires first defeatingSkeletron(seeAccessbelow).
In thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderversions, some passages are blocked off byCracked Dungeon Bricks. These blocks look almost identical to regular dungeon brick, but appear slightly crumbled, and drop no blocks when destroyed. Breaking one block may break adjacent false blocks in a chain similar to the behavior ofDesert Fossil.  False blocks may also break spontaneously when the player walks on them or uses a grappling hook. Using aDangersense Potionwill highlight these blocks. Cracked Dungeon Bricks also conceal large, rectangular rooms lined with spikes and occasionally filled with water, so caution is advised.
The Dungeon contains a dense assortment of uniquefurnitureandMechanismsthat can be retrieved by the player for later use.Chain LanternsarewiredtoSwitches, which the player can toggle on and off. SeveralDart Trapsare wired toPressure Plates, providing an extra hazard to players. Traps like these can also sometimes be found above-ground at the Dungeon's entrance. The boundMechanicis found below 0', and is freed when spoken to.
There are many shelves in the Dungeon, on which areBooks,Lesser Healing Potions,Lesser Mana Potions, and occasionallyWater CandlesandWater Bolts, which appears as a blue book with a yellow stripe in placed form.Life Crystalscannot spawn in the Dungeon.
There are several lockedGold Chestscontaining both loot unique to the Dungeon and standardUndergroundloot. AGolden Keyis required to open each of these, and will be consumed upon unlocking a chest. LockedBiome Chestsare also present, but they can only be opened afterPlanterais defeated and the player has obtained a respectiveBiome Key.
AfterPlanterais defeated, the Dungeon spawns new, more powerful enemies, which offer access to new items. Not all enemies spawn in all Dungeons: The particular background wall type generated for a particular Dungeon, as well as the corresponding Faction Flags scattered around, determine which post-Plantera enemies spawn there (seebelow).
On thePC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacyversions, after a player defeatsGolemandSkeletronin a world, a group of 4Cultistswill spawn at the entrance of the Dungeon. Killing them will summon theLunatic Cultist, and killing the Lunatic Cultist will initiate theLunar Events, an end-gameevent.
To gain unrestricted access to the Dungeon,Skeletronmust first be defeated. Skeletron is summoned by speaking to theOld Man, who guards the Dungeon entrance. AtNight, a ""curse"" option will be displayed, which will turn the Old Man into Skeletron when clicked. Speaking to the Old Man during theDaywill not allow the player to fight Skeletron. By defeating Skeletron, theClothierNPCbecomes available, and will spawn when a suitable vacanthouseis available.
The Dungeon can be entered but not fully explored before Skeletron is defeated. Traveling to -3depthin the Dungeon before it has been defeated will summonDungeon Guardianswhich will generally kill most players with a single hit. The Dungeon Guardians are practically invincible, and killing them willnotgrant access to the Dungeon, and the only item gained from defeating a Dungeon Guardian is theBone Key.
The player can tell if the requirements to spawn Dungeon Guardians are met if the music changes to the Dungeon track, or if they have aDepth Meterequipped that reads ""Level"" or ""X' Underground"". Dungeon entrances are located at varying heights, but are always some distance above zero depths, making their entrance structures and 1-2 screens of depth generally safe from Guardians.
WhenPlanterais defeated for the first time in a world, thestatus message""Screams are echoing from the dungeon...""appears, meaning that newenemieswill now appear in the Dungeon. They are generally much more difficult than ordinary Dungeon enemies, and drop new powerful items. It also becomes possible to open theBiome Chestspresent in the Dungeon.
The particular post-Plantera enemies thatspawnin a Dungeon area are based off of thebackground walls, present, which also correspond to theFaction Flagsfound naturally placed in the area. A single Dungeon can contain multiple background wall types in different sections, or just one type. Whether a Dungeon contains different types can only be determined by exploring the Dungeon. Each wall type has ""usual"" enemies to spawn, but there is always a small chance of other Dungeon enemies spawning, and this chance is increased if aluckyplayer is present. For example, Skeleton Snipers can still rarely spawn in areas with Dungeon Brick Walls, even if no Slab Walls are nearby.

Dyes,"An example of color coordinated clothing using Dyes.
Wood armorshown dyed with all available dyes.
My dear, what you're wearing is much too drab. You absolutely must take a lesson in dyeing your tired attire!
—The Dye Trader
Dyesare items that can be placed in the ""Dye Slots"" of a player'sinventoryto alter the colors and/or textures of equippedarmor,vanity items, andaccessories. TheDye TraderNPCsells two dyes (Silver DyeandBrown Dye) as well as theDye Vat(5). The other dyes must be crafted using the Dye Vat or obtained through trading inStrange Plantsto the Dye Trader. Primary crafted dyes can be further combined to craft shade, gradient, and patterned dyes. There are currently119 /116 /68 different dyes in the game (118 / 115 / 67 on single-player worlds, asTeam Dyeis not available in single-player worlds). Some dyes will make sprites visible in complete darkness, most of which are Strange Dyes.
Dyes are not available on theNintendo3DSversion, due to the unavailability of pixel shaders.
All basic dyes are crafted at theDye Vat. Their crafting ingredients (not includingSilver DyeandBrown Dye) can be found growing asbackground objectsin the natural world or are guaranteed drops from special enemies. Alldye plantsshow on the map. None of the Basic Dyes are visible in complete darkness.
All colored basic dyes (except for black) can be combined with Silver Dye to craft Bright Dyes at theDye Vat. None of the Bright Dyes are visible in complete darkness.
These dyes produce fade effects between multiple colors. They are crafted at theDye Vat. None of the Gradient Dyes are visible in complete darkness.
These dyes form patterns with multiple colors, applied as separate blocks depending on the shape of the item. All colored basic dyes, and some ""flame"" gradient dyes, can be combined with Black or Silver Dye to craft ""<Color> and Black Dye"" or ""<Color> and Silver Dye"", respectively. They are crafted at theDye Vat. None of the Compound Dyes are visible in complete darkness.
These dye are given as quest rewards by theDye Traderin exchange forStrange Plants. Dyes with araritylevel of Orange or Cyan can only be awarded in aHardmodeworld even if strange plants are somehow obtained in pre-hardmode. Note thatStrange Plantsonly begin growing inHardmode.
Strange Dyes have varying degrees of visibility in complete darkness."
Dye_Trader,"TheDye Traderis anNPCthat sells theDye Vatand otherdye-related items. He will move in when the following criteria have been met:
In addition to selling dye-related items, players may trade in Strange Plants for uncraftable and unpurchasable animated dyesonceHardmodehas been reached. These dyes are given at random in sets of six/ threefor each exchanged Strange Plant.
The Dye Trader will attack nearby enemies with hisExotic Scimitarto defend himself, and may drop his weapon on death. He will deal 11 /16/19damage at the start of the game,and as players progress he will gainvarious stat increases.

Speaking to the Dye Trader will show the ""Strange Plants"" quest (inHardmode), in which the Dye Trader asks players to fetch him rare plants. In return, he rewards players with six/ threevials of a special dye which cannot be obtained otherwise. More of these dyes become available as the game progresses.

For more information, seeNPC happiness.
When submerged inShimmer, the Dye Trader will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again.

Eater_of_Worlds,"TheEater of Worldsis apre-HardmodeCorruption-themedwormboss. It is summoned usingWorm Foodfrom within theCorruptionandUnderground Corruption, or by destroying 3Shadow Orbsthat spawn in Corruption-filled worlds. It can be summoned at any time of day. Do note that Eater of Worlds shootsvile spitinExpertandMaster mode.
The Eater of Worlds is not a single target, but a string of segments with individual life counters. When any inner body segment is destroyed, it splits into multiple smaller worms, each with their own head and tail. Each section of the Eater must be killed in order to defeat the entire boss. The Eater of Worlds, like all worms, is immune tolava.
On thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderversions, it has a total of 67 /72segments[1], and is only immune to theConfuseddebuff.
On theOld-gen console,Windows Phone,Old Chinese,3DS, andtModLoader Legacyversions, it has a total of 50 segments, and is immune to thePoisoned,Confused,Cursed Inferno,Shadowflame,On Fire!, andVenomdebuffs.
Fighting the Eater of Worlds is the only way to obtainShadow Scales, and it's one of the only ways to obtain usable quantities ofDemonite Ore, both necessary for crafting aNightmare Pickaxe. Individual segments drop some of these when killed, with a larger bonus drop upon defeating the entire entity[2]. Defeating the Eater of Worlds allows theTavernkeepNPCto spawn, andmeteoritesto land.
The Eater of Worlds is the Corruptioncounterpartto theCrimson'sBrain of Cthulhu. TheHardmodemechanical bossequivalent to the Eater of Worlds is theDestroyer.

Empress_of_Light,"

TheEmpress of Lightis aHardmode, post-Planterabossfought inThe Hallow. While she can be fought as soon asPlanterais defeated, she is significantly more difficult than most Hardmode bosses and will typically require post-Golemgear. The Empress of Light fight is optional and is not required for progression. Her appearance is that of a yellow-skinned fairy with bioluminescent wings, a crown and dress.
While the Empress of Light is alive, her exclusive musicEmpress of Lighthttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Empress_of_Light.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
The Empress of Light is summoned by killing aPrismatic Lacewing, a rarecritterthat spawns in the surfaceHallowat night between 7:30 PM - 12:00 AM oncePlanterahas been defeated in the current world. The Prismatic Lacewing is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.
The Prismatic Lacewing can be killed at any time in any biome to summon the boss. However, if released outside of theHallowbiome it will despawn near instantly, so it must be placed onto a persisting and damaging projectile or by using a weapon that could attack and kill it before the critter vanishes.
Although the Prismatic Lacewing only spawns naturally in worlds where Plantera has been defeated, it is possible to bring one to an artificial hallow inPre-Hardmodeand kill it to summon the boss.
Like most critters, the Prismatic Lacewing can be caught with anybug net, and can then be released and killed by the player.
If fought during the day, the Empress enters an ""enraged"" state, indicated by the color of attacks turning a bright yellow. While enraged, all of her attacks instantly kill the player regardless of equipment.
See below for exceptions.
If summoned during the day and not defeated in time, she will vanish at 7:30PM and drop nothing.
If fought inExpertorMaster Mode, she will always use her enraged attack pattern, but without the massive damage increase.
The Empress has set attack patterns for both of her phases.
When spawned, the Empress will hover in place for a few seconds before executing the following attacks in order:
This sequence of attacks repeats indefinitely until the second phase starts.
When the Empress is below half of her max health, she will disappear for a second then reappear above the next estimated location of the player, adopting a new appearance before executing a new set of attacks, with slightly shorter attack intervals than before:
This sequence of attacks repeats indefinitely until she is defeated.

Enemies,"Enemiesare characters that attempt to inflictdamageon players. This page lists all enemies that can be encountered inTerraria.
Enemies do not takefall damage. SeeNPC spawningandNPC despawningfor details on how the game determines where and when enemies spawn.
There are a total of 371 enemies: 139pre-Hardmode, 231Hardmode, and 1 unspawnable. Out of these, 121 belong toevents(26 pre-Hardmode and 95 Hardmode), 20 arebosses(9 pre-Hardmode and 11 Hardmode), 14 are event bosses (1 pre-Hardmode and 13 Hardmode), 19 are bosses' servants (7 pre-Hardmode and 12 Hardmode), and 14 are enemy variants exclusive to theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version, andNintendo3DSversion(7 pre-Hardmode and 7 Hardmode).

"
Events#Hardmode,"An example of an event. In this case, it is theFrost Legion.
The progress bar's range; on the left is the house and the right the limit, on a small world.
Events(some also known asInvasions) are short-term occasions where varieties of specialenemiesspawn, most at elevated spawn rates, even nearNPCswithout needing to use a water candle, and attack players. Some events can occur randomly during gameplay, while others can be triggered via certain summoning items or special circumstances. Events spawn their own unique enemies during ordinary gameplay, which can, in turn, drop unique items that are only obtainable within the event. Some events also bring unique visuals and a unique atmosphere, such as an alteredMoonand noticeable shaders applied to the screen. Events also are accompanied by their own special music, adding on to their theme. Depending on the particular event, they may last until a certain time limit is reached, or until a certain number of enemies are defeated.
On all versions, a progress bar can be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen to indicate how far the player has gone into the event, and how far they are from completing it. It only appears during invasion-style events (Goblin Army,Slime Rain(only if 75/150 slimes are defeated),Old One's Army,Frost Legion,Pirate Invasion,Pumpkin Moon,Frost Moon, andMartian Madness) and will not appear during events that are time-limited (Blood Moon, Rain,Slime Rain(only if less than 75/150 slimes are killed),Sandstorm, andSolar Eclipse).
Note that certain invasions (Goblin Army,Frost Legion,Pirate Invasion, andMartian Madness) have location requirements. The player must be no deeper than 67.5 tiles below the surface, and the player must be within 187.5 tiles horizontally of the location of the invasion. If the invasion has reached the center of the world, then the horizontal check can also be satisfied by the player being within 187.5 tiles horizontally of any town NPC, although at a reduced spawn rate. The town NPC's vertical position is not checked and so they can be housed far above or below your arena.
There are currently19 /14 /8 different events and invasions.

The objective is to protect the Eternia Crystal from waves of enemies seeking to destroy it. If the Crystal is destroyed by enemies, the event terminates. If it is kept safe until all waves are cleared, the event is won.
Both the Crystal and its Stand are purchased from theTavernkeepNPC forcoins. Players are inflicted with theCreative Shockdebuff for the duration of the event, which prevents the removal or placement ofblocksduring the entire event within a certain range.
Each wave becomes progressively more difficult. If triggered before anyMechanical Bosseshave been defeated, the event consists of 5 waves. If triggered after at least one Mechanical Boss is defeated, the event consists of 7 waves.

The player can not challenge the event again once the player has a Torch God's Favor either in their inventory or consumed, and must create another character to do so.

The event is completed after a certain number of snowmen have been defeated. Afterward, theSanta ClausNPC will spawn duringChristmas.
A solar eclipse is happening!
Occurs with a 1/20 chance each day upon dawn, as soon as anyMechanical Bosshas been defeated, or when manually summoned with aSolar Tablet.

Events,"An example of an event. In this case, it is theFrost Legion.
The progress bar's range; on the left is the house and the right the limit, on a small world.
Events(some also known asInvasions) are short-term occasions where varieties of specialenemiesspawn, most at elevated spawn rates, even nearNPCswithout needing to use a water candle, and attack players. Some events can occur randomly during gameplay, while others can be triggered via certain summoning items or special circumstances. Events spawn their own unique enemies during ordinary gameplay, which can, in turn, drop unique items that are only obtainable within the event. Some events also bring unique visuals and a unique atmosphere, such as an alteredMoonand noticeable shaders applied to the screen. Events also are accompanied by their own special music, adding on to their theme. Depending on the particular event, they may last until a certain time limit is reached, or until a certain number of enemies are defeated.
On all versions, a progress bar can be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen to indicate how far the player has gone into the event, and how far they are from completing it. It only appears during invasion-style events (Goblin Army,Slime Rain(only if 75/150 slimes are defeated),Old One's Army,Frost Legion,Pirate Invasion,Pumpkin Moon,Frost Moon, andMartian Madness) and will not appear during events that are time-limited (Blood Moon, Rain,Slime Rain(only if less than 75/150 slimes are killed),Sandstorm, andSolar Eclipse).
Note that certain invasions (Goblin Army,Frost Legion,Pirate Invasion, andMartian Madness) have location requirements. The player must be no deeper than 67.5 tiles below the surface, and the player must be within 187.5 tiles horizontally of the location of the invasion. If the invasion has reached the center of the world, then the horizontal check can also be satisfied by the player being within 187.5 tiles horizontally of any town NPC, although at a reduced spawn rate. The town NPC's vertical position is not checked and so they can be housed far above or below your arena.

Eye_of_Cthulhu,"TheEye of Cthulhuis apre-Hardmodeboss. It is one of the first bosses a player may encounter, as it spawns automatically when a relatively early level of game advancement is achieved. It can also be summoned manually with theSuspicious Looking Eyeat night (seeSpawnbelow).
While the Eye of Cthulhu is alive, the musicBoss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
On theOld-gen console version,Boss 5https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_5.mp3will play.
The Eye of Cthulhu can be summoned manually using aSuspicious Looking Eyeatnight(beginning at 7:30PM in-game time).
It also has a33.33*1/3 (33.33%)chance of spawning automatically each night, if the following conditions apply:
If spawning this way, its arrival is announced by thestatus message""You feel an evil presence watching you..."". If the player is sufficiently far underground, the Eye of Cthulhu will not spawn until they return to the Surface. If they remain underground all night, the boss will not spawn at all.
The Eye of Cthulhu has two phases, and is able to fly through blocks in both of them. During the first, it attempts to float directly above the player, while spawning 3–4Servants of Cthulhu, which dropHeartsandStarson death. A servant is spawned with thetypical hit soundhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:NPC_Hit_1.wav. Afterward, it charges at the player three times in succession, before repeating the cycle.
When the Eye of Cthulhu falls below 50% /65%health (1,400 /2,366/3,016), it transforms into its second form (shedding its iris into a mouth), which rams the player more aggressively three times, then hangs in the air for a period. It no longer spawns Servants of Cthulhu, and has nodefense, but now has increased contact damage. It now lets out aroarhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Roar_0.wavevery time it charges.
InExpert Mode, the boss spawns more Servants of Cthulhu than normal, as well as 4–5 servants upon transforming. In the second phase, it will gain an additional powerful rapid chain dash attack, during which it lets out ahigher-pitched roarhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:EoC_Expert_Roar.wavevery time it dashes. These dashes become faster as the Eye of Cthulhu's life decreases, and it can dash nearly continuously when close to death.
If Eye of Cthulhu is not defeated by dawn (4:30AM), if all players die, or if it goes too far off-screen, it will despawn.

Fishing,"The world is filled to the brim with the most outlandish kinds of fish!
—The Angler
Fishing in action.
Fishingis accomplished by using aFishing Poleat a body ofliquid(water,honey, orlava) while havingbaitin the player'sinventory. While near the body of liquid, pressing the⚒Use / Attackbutton at a point over the liquid will cast a line into the liquid. Pressing the button again when the bobber moves up and down will reel in the line and often an item will come up with the line. TheAnglerNPC provides daily fishing quests and rewards their completion with an assortment of equipment, coins, potions, and vanity items.
Fishing provides resources: Crafting materials forpotionsandfood, a variety of very useful items such as mobility improvements like aFrog LegorBalloon Pufferfish, and even a petZephyr Fish. Throughcrates, fishing also provides an alternative source forores,coins, manychestitems (Sailfish Bootscan replaceHermesorFlurry Boots), and some specialties such as the powerfulFalcon Blade.
While fishing is not strictly necessary for game progression, some of the Angler's quest rewards (theFish Findercomponents) are required to complete theShellphone. Fishing is also required to fight thebossDuke Fishron. To summon the boss, aTruffle Wormmust be used as fishing bait in anOceanbiome.
For pre-Hardmode players, fishing can be a good way of getting money and equipment; by mid-Hardmode, it is less competitive withother money-making options, enemy drops, and advancing equipment.
Surface width is determined first (green rectangle), then the depth below those tiles (arrows). Tiles falling outside the originally calculated surface width are not counted (red areas).
75 connected tiles of liquid are required (1,001 forOceans, 50 forhoney) in order for fishing to work, and 300 or more tiles to be optimal (1,001 forOceans, 200 forhoney). The width of the top row of continuous liquid tiles (the row where the fishing bobber sits) determines the calculated pond width, and then the depth directly below those is counted. If the pond becomes wider at lower depths, that additional width isnotcounted. The player may successfully fish in a 1-tile-wide pond, as long as it's 75 tiles deep. The minimal required depth is 2 tiles.VerifyNothing will ever bite while the bobber is floating over a pond that's 1 tile deep and 300 tiles wide. The distance of the bobber to the shoreline does not matter. No fish will bite if the bobber can't fully come up and float on water. This can happen if a solid block is right above water level and is blocking the bobber. The bobber will also move horizontally while something is on the hook. If it ends up in a position where it can't float on top of water, nothing will be able to bite after.
It is not possible to fish when the player is submerged in liquid, even partially, and even within a completely disconnected body of water. Fishing can, however, be done while moving, flying, whilegrappledto blocks, sitting on a chair, while floating on water with theSlime Mount, while mounted on a minecart, or while standing on top of the water, e.g. usingWater Walking Boots.
Fishing can be done inLava, but will only work with theHotline Fishing Hook, aLavaproof Tackle Bag, aLavaproof Fishing Hook, or by using aMagma Snail,Lavafly, orHell Butterfly(which can be caught using aLavaproof Bug NetorGolden Bug Net). It can take much longer to get a bite in lava, but the chances increase with at least two of these sources; see theCatch Frequencysection below for details.
Catching a quest fish for theAnglerNPCrequires fishing in the properbiome, andheightfor the day's current quest, which can be determined by talking to the Angler. Quest fish cannot be caught if the player already has that particular quest fish in their inventory, or if the quest fish was already turned in that day. However, if the player puts the Quest fish in a safe/bank then they may catch another Quest Fish. The player can then transfer the Quest Fish to a chest if they wish. TheAnglergives outspecial rewardswhen a proper quest fish is turned in. The player does not need to speak with him beforehand, nor have even encountered him, but the chances of finding the correct area to fish for a quest are much lower without speaking to him first. Each day, the angler will change his quest at 4:30AM.
Given the prerequisites for fishing are fulfilled, some factors influence the quality/rarity of the caught item. There is a variety of relevant equipment:
All the factors are combined into a totalFishing Powerthat determines the chances of higher-quality catches. Fishing Power is calculated by starting with adding these three basic factors:
After the above three kinds of factors are added, bonuses (or penalties) are applied, as follows:
Amounts in the tables below that influence fishing power are markedgreenorred. Because some of the bonus factors are percentages, the fishing power amounts given by any of the three basic factors can seem to vary depending on, e.g., time of day or weather. (For example, when fishing during rain, theAngler Earringcan appear to provide more than just +10 Fishing Power.)



Allows fishing in lava regardless of bait or rod used.










++++()






There are two factors which affect Fishing Power that are hidden from the player (e.g. they never affect the numbers displayed in the UI by the Fisherman's Pocket Guide or related accessories):
Fishing Polesare used withbaitfor fishing. Some are craftable, while others are either sold byNPCs, found inChests, or are awarded by theAngler.













If the player has multiple bait items in their inventory, they are used in order from the top down, then left to right. Bait can be placed in ammo slots, and bait placed there will be used first/ used last. To have the best results from fishing in lava, lavaproof bait should be placed before other bait.
For more information, seeBait.
These items can be caught at any time. Most can serve ascrafting materialforFood(Cooked Fish) and otherPotions. Some can also craft other item types. Jellyfish can be used as bait. Most can be sold toNPCs.  Note that the height requirements are mostly split between ""Surface and above,"" versus ""Underground and below.""  Of these items, only three items cannot be caught in either the Surface or Underground layers:  The Damselfish (Sky only) and the Blue or Green Jellyfish (Cavern or Underworld only).
Quest fish are items that can be caught only when their particular quest is active and serve no purpose other than acquiringquest rewards. The player can determine the day's quest by speaking to theAnglerNPC. There are 41 distinctive variants of quest fish.
These items can be used directly without further crafting. Most areToolsorWeapons, many of which are best-in-class for large parts of the game. There are also a couple ofAccessoriesoffering jump boosts, an improvement on Healing Potions, aPet, and inHardmode, a mount summon. TheAngler'srewards fill out the set somewhat, with anearly mount, a top-tier (Pre-Hardmode)Hook, and several items to help with fishing.
Crates are stackable grab-bag type items that each contain random loot, includingpotions, bait, useful items,coins,metal bars, and evenores. They can be right-clicked from within the player's inventory, which will unload their contents. Rarer Crate types contain more valuable loot. The biome crates can provide items otherwise found only in the matching biome chests, includingCrimson Hearts/Shadow Orbsand the items found in Dungeon chests. (Not all biomes or special chests have matching crates.) Crates are one of the major sources of ""alternate"" metals and ores.
These items have nocoinvalue, they can however be put through anextractinatorto receive either fishing worms/apprentice fishing bait. They can each be stacked up to 99 in a single inventory slot. The player will only ""catch"" these if a lake is too small or if their Fishing Power is too low. When a lake is at least 300 tiles (200 for honey) in size or the player's total fishing power is at least 50, the player will no longer catch junk.
Additionally, the player has a 1/8 (12.5%) chance of catching aJoja Colainstead of a junk item when fishing.
Note that the Seaweed junk item should not be confused with theSeaweedpet summon item, which is found in Jungle Crates and Bramble Crates fished up in the jungle, as well as Jungle shrines and Living Rich Mahogany Trees.
During aBlood Moonevent, fishing in water can cause several Blood Moon-themed enemies to spawn. These enemies are:
Upon retracting the line during a Blood Moon, there is a16.67*1/6 (16.67%)chance (33.33*1/3 (33.33%)with theChum Caster) that one of these enemies will spawn. Note thatfishing powerhas no effect on this mechanic, nor does the use of Chum Buckets.
If the player is using a Sonar Potion, the spawn will be shown with the enemy's name in red, giving players a second or two to prepare for the oncoming attack. In pre-Hardmode, the only enemies that can appear are the Zombie Merman and the Wandering Eye Fish, with an equal chance of each. In Hardmode, the Dreadnautilus has a10*1/10 (10%)chance of appearing, and the other four enemies have equal remaining chances of appearing (22.5*9/40 (22.5%)).
Each of these enemies has a chance to dropChum Bucketsused to further increase fishing power.  They also can drop several special items:
When fishing, there is a hiddencatch counterwhich tracks the player's progress toward making a catch. The counter normally starts at 0 and increases over time. When it exceeds 660, there is a ((75 + fishing power) / 2) % chance that a fish will bite, capping out at 125 fishing power. The counter then resets to 0, regardless of whether or not there was a bite.
When fishing in lava with at least two lava-proof bait, aHotline Fishing Hookor one of the two lava-proof accessories (Lavaproof Fishing HookorLavaproof Tackle Bag), the counter resets to 240 instead (if there was no bite). Using all three has the same effect as using only two[1].
The catch counter increases every tick (there are 60 ticks per second) according to these factors:
Therefore, a formula for the average catch rate would look like this:or simply:For example, with a fishing power of 125, the player can expect to catch a fish around once every 1.5 seconds:
A player can be eligible for catching fish from multiple biomes at once; however, certain biomes take priority over others. The priority order is:
The player can ""borrow"" the Forest lake for the mushroom biome.
The height requirement (Sky/Surface/Underground/Cavern) is set by the height of the surface of the water, not by the position of the player. This can be taken advantage of by creating two adjacent pools of water on different layers. This allows the player to fish in either while standing at the same spot.
There are five height zones for fishing(seeLayers):
Chance of successful roll for each catch quality slot at a given displayed Fishing Power. Sharp changes are due to integer rounding.
There are 6 differentcatch quality slotsfor catches, each with its own associated probability:
The denominators are rounded down. A fishing power of 85, for example, would have a1.92*1/52 (1.92%)chance of an Extremely Rare catch.
When a new fish is generated, each different catch quality is checked for success, separately from one another. For example, the Uncommon, Rare, and Very Rare rolls might all succeed, while the Common and Extremely Rare rolls fail. Then, depending on which roll(s) succeed as well as factors such as height and biome, the game will generate a fish.
With some exceptions, the highest catch quality roll that succeeded will take priority over lower catch quality slots in determining which fish a player receives. However, not every catch quality slot will contain a fish that can be caught; in that case, the game will move on to checking lower catch qualities. Success at the higher catch quality roll willnotcarry down to lower quality slots. For example, if the Rare roll succeeded but there is no Rare fish available to be caught, the game will move on to checking whether or not the Uncommon roll succeeded; if the Uncommon roll failed, it will move on to checking Common.
Each biome has a list of available biome-specific fish that can be caught there, based on the catch quality rolls and other factors. If no biome-specific fish is generated, the game will move on to checking subsequent, lower priority biomes. Many of the fish available in catch quality slots vary based on randomness, so succeeding at a catch quality roll in a specific biome does not guarantee that the player will get a specific fish of that quality or any fish of that quality at all. If no fish is selected for the slot, the game will proceed to check more common slots instead and move on to subsequent biomes if and only if none of those slots contain fish either.
When fishing in the water, a successful Extremely Rare roll will always check for a special catch first (Frog Leg, Balloon Pufferfish, and Zephyr Fish, in that order). If none of these checks succeed, the game will then check for biome-specific fish.
All quest fish occupy the Uncommon slot, except the Mirage Fish and Pixiefish, which are Rare.All quest fish are Uncommon.
There are only four Plentiful fish:Bass,Trout,Flounder, andRock Lobster. If all other checks fail and the player is fishing in the water, they will catch one of these by default: Trout if fishing in theOcean, Flounder or Rock Lobster if fishing in theDesertorOasisonPC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version(with Rock Lobster being half as common as Flounder), and Bass otherwise.
There is a separate roll to determine if aCrateis caught, defaulting to 10% (or 20% with aCrate Potionactive). An Extremely Rare or Very Rare catch will generate a Golden Crate, a Rare catch will generate a biome-specific crate (if applicable, otherwise it will generate an Iron Crate), an Uncommon catch will generate an Iron Crate, and a Wooden Crate otherwise.In Hardmode, the crate will be the Hardmode-equivalent crate.
Fishing in honey will never generate a crate.Fishing in lava can generateObsidian Cratesin pre-hardmode, andHellstone Cratesin hardmode.
Stackable fish (i.e., Bomb Fish and Frost Daggerfish) generate in stacks that vary based on the player's fishing power. These can vary significantly, with higher fishing power levels generating higher minimum stack sizes as well as significantly higher maximum stack sizes.
The Angler gives six different accessories as rewards, but with theTinkerer's Workshop, those can be combined into one functional and one informational accessory:
A quest fish cannot be fished or picked up when the player already has one in inventory, but it is easy enough to stash the fish in aChest,Piggy Bank, or even the trash slot (though you can easily lose the fish this way) and collect multiples.
Fishing in long stretches can be tedious and isalso notvery efficient.  It is better to fish in smaller stretches and cherry-pick the times (moon, weather,luck) when the player has bonuses:
Any time 3AM or 3PM approaches, the player should check conditions: With overcast/rain, a full moon, or a lucky event (ladybugswarm orLantern Night), if the other two factors are at least neutral, then it is worth trying for a fishing session.
Even if the player isn't primarily fishing for crates, the 4-minute duration of aCrate Potionmakes a good benchmark. Even one potion will usually give more than enough time to collect several crates and several copies of a quest fish if one is available.
Starting a fishing session between 3:00-4:30 AM or 4:30-6:00 PM will allow the Crate potion's duration to cover one of the ""prime times"" noted above while avoiding the following ""dead time."" If conditions are still good when the first potion runs out, a second potion may be worthwhile even if it runs into dead time, and it may even be worth finishing out theSonar Potion's duration.
Aportable storageitem allows a quick-change into and out of fishing gear, including swapping armor for the Fishing set.
Lava fishing can begin pre-Hardmode but can get easier in Hardmode. The player needs at least one out of three factors (bait, pole, accessory), and having two of them will drastically speed up catches:
The maximum possible Fishing Power is 346/ 283/ 264.
Equipment bonuses add to 170:
Theweather,Moon phaseandTime of daybonuses multiply that:
TheChum Bucketadds further bonuses:
Other bonuses:
Luck has the potential to further increase Fishing Power: With +1.4 luck, 346 Fishing Power can randomly become up to486Fishing Power for any given cast.
Once a player has theirGolden Bug Net,Golden Fishing Rod,Fish Finder, and anAngler Tackle Bag(or even two Tackle Bags, and/or a spareAngler Earring), theAnglercan give them little else untilHardmode. Fishing without the Angler can still be profitable, notably by collectingcratesand other special catches.
Angler reward chances generally rise over time, but after the 150th Angler quest, most of the reward chances go back to their initial odds and stay there. Once the player has gotten the important pre-Hardmode rewards, they should leave off Angler quests until Hardmode, and hopefully avoid hitting the deadline before getting the Hardmode rewards. It is also helpful to stockpile crates before Hardmode, which can be opened in Hardmode for an early source ofHardmode oresandbars.
After Hardmode, there are only a couple more weapons and a mount to catch (ToxikarporBladetongue,Crystal Serpent,Scaly Truffle), and a few more useful Angler rewards: TheBottomless Water BucketandSuper Absorbant Spongefor water handling, and theHotline Fishing Hook(a misnamed pole) for fishing in lava.  Once a player has all that, they're done with the Angler Quests. Fishing can still provide potion resupply, bars (especially the alternates), and coins (the Scaly Truffle is a good target), but no new items after this point."
Floating_Islands,"Floating IslandsandFloating Lakesare floating structures located generally well above the world's main land mass and can be found all the way up toSpace. Their location makes them susceptible toHarpiesinpre-HardmodeandWyvernsandArch WyvernsinHardmode. Being at such high altitude, players have reduced gravity when navigating them. Both are similar in size and placement, and both rest atopCloudandRain Cloudblocks with backgroundCloud Walls.
A typical Floating Island
A Floating Island contains a mass of isolatedForestland and ahouse-like structure. Each world will contain at least one Floating Island, up to a possible nine maximum inlargeworlds.
Two Floating Islands very close to each other
A Floating Island will usually contain a structure constructed fromSunplate Block,Disc Wall, andGlass Wall. It will always contain exactly oneSkyware Chestalong with other randomSkyware furniture. It will either have three or fivebackground wallsin between each window. Each Skyware Chest contains one of 4 rare items (theFledgling Wings/Lucky Horseshoe,Starfury, orShiny Red Balloon), has a 1/3 chance of containing aSky Mill, and contains other typicalSurface Chest loot. Unique items are chosen at random, with the restriction that all three unique items must be spawned at least once before truly random unique items spawn on any remaining Islands (if less than three islands are generated, the wings won't be spawned and if only one is generated, it will contain a Shiny Red Balloon).
A typical Floating Lake.
Floating Lakes consist of nothing more than a large body ofwater, suitable forfishing. There will be relatively few of these in a world. Unlike Floating Islands, they have neitherSunplate Blockstructures nor any of their contents. Several exclusive catches can be found there, like theDamselfish,Sky Crates/Azure Cratesand some quest fish including the sky-exclusiveCloudfish.
Floating Lakes can rarely containWater Chests.

Forest,"TheForestis abiomethat comprises the majority of thesurfaceworld and is typically where the player initiallyspawns. The global landscape of a Forest includes lots ofgrass, plenty oftrees, lakes of various sizes, and occasional hills that can reveal cave entrances. Forests often contain one or moreLiving Treesthat sometimes have an underground treasure room.
The Forest changes noticeably in the outer sixths of the world.Goblin Scouts, which are fairly uncommon and dropTattered Cloth, begin to spawn. TheKing Slimebossalso has a very low chance to spawn and can easily surprise and overwhelm an unsuspecting player.Enchanted Sword Shrinesare only found in the outer thirds of the world in the Forest as well.

Frost_Legion,"Frost Legion attacking in aSnowbiome.
TheFrost Legionis aHardmodeeventduring which unique Snowmanenemiesspawn and swarm a player'sspawn point, similar to theGoblin Army. It is summoned using theSnow Globe, and defeating it unlocks theSanta ClausNPC.
The Frost Legion must be summoned using theSnow Globe, which is acquired fromPresentsobtained during theChristmasseasonal event (December 15–31 /December 1–January 15 /one in-game day after defeatingFrost Moon).  Unlike the Goblin Army, the Frost Legion can only be summoned by the player, using the Snow Globe. The Legion will never invade on its own.  Similarly, while Presents only drop during the Christmas event, they can be opened anytime.  To obtain a Snow Globe, the present must be opened in Hardmode, but not necessarily during Christmas.  Even though the Snow Globe can only be obtained in Hardmode, the Frost Legion can be summoned in apre-Hardmodeworld, and it does not need to be during Christmas.
When summoned, astatus messagewill appear:""The Frost Legion is approaching from the [east/west]!""
The direction specified in this message only pertains to the initial wave of Snowmen, which spawns at the world's edge and travels to the player's original spawn point. Additional waves spawn immediately within the player's original spawn area. If the message says ""west"", the Snowmen will come from the left. If the message says ""east"", they will arrive from the right. Note that these directions arenotrelated to theapparent motion of the sun and the moon, which, in Terraria, appear to move from left (""west"") to right (""east"").
When the Frost Legion is about to begin spawning around the player's spawn point, the following status message appears:""The Frost Legion has arrived!""The thememusicwill switch to theBoss 3theme."
Frost_Moon,"TheFrost Moonis aHardmode, post-Plantera, Christmas-themedeventsummoned with theNaughty Presentat any time atnight, ending at dawn (4:30AM). It can be summoned at any time of the year and does not require the actualChristmas season. During the event, unique and highly difficult enemies spawn at high rates and attack the player. It is similar to thePumpkin Moonevent, but consists of more waves and includes slightly more content. Visually, the moon turns into a snowman head, though remaining in its currentphase.
The entire event consists of 15 waves, plus 5 ""bonus waves"". Waves progress as the player reaches certain kill scores (though kill scores are not displayed to the player before wave 20). After a wave's required score is met, the next wave begins, and the kill score is reset to 0.Status messageswill indicate when the wave has advanced, and which wave has been achieved. See the tablebelowfor the points awarded for each enemy and the score required for each wave.
The Frost Moon event always ends at 4:30 AM. The goal of the event is to progress through all 20 wavesbeforethe event ends, although theachievementfor the event is awarded at wave 15.[1]
TheNaughty Present, which summons the Frost Moon, requires materials only available inHardmodeworlds where the player has already defeatedPlantera(although it can still be summoned inpre-Hardmodeworlds). As such, it is intended to present a challenge even to players with the best possible equipment. In the final waves, multipleboss-level enemies are fought at once.
Frost Moon enemies drop powerfulweapons, as well aspetandvanity items. Most drop with extreme rarity, and even players who manage to complete the event will find they need to do so several times before obtaining them. Drop chances for items dropped by bosses increase as waves are completed. See the sectionbelowfor a more detailed description of the rates at which loot and trophies drop.
Reaching wave15 /20 before 4:30 AM will display the message “The spirit of Christmas spreads cheer...” at dawn (4:30 AM). For the entire day and night, all special effects of theChristmas seasonwill occur. At 4:30 AM of the next day, the message “The spirit of Christmas fades...” will appear and all Christmas events will no longer occur until the Christmas season begins again or the player reaches the 15th wave of the Frost Moon again.[2]"
Furniture,"Furnitureis a class ofitemsthat can beplacedonblocks, or hung from them, usually to become background objects that characters can move over and through. Some are functional, such ascrafting stations,Chests,Beds,mechanisms, andlight sources(among others), while many are mainly decorative. Most furniture items are sorted intosets. Furniture is acquired through crafting, by collecting furniture items that appear naturally in the world, dropped byPirates, or purchasing fromNPCs. Most placed furniture can be freed with apickaxe.
Although primarily decorative, when placed, thePink Vase,Mug, and variouscupsalso serve as aPlaced Bottlecrafting station.
Lavawill dislodge most placed furniture, with the exception ofpumps,statues, andObsidian Furniturefound in theRuined Housesof theUnderworld.
Although furniture can not beactuatedin-game, if done through the use of externalMap viewersthat have world editing feature, they still work, i.e. beds can still be slept in."

Gems,"Gemsare valuablecrafting materialsfound underground. There are currently 7 gem types. Gems can also be placed on any side of a block after being mined. They are found in anyundergroundlayer, except forThe Underworld.
Gems are found in the following forms;
Gems can also be found in higher concentrations in raregemstone caves, which can contain multiple gem types lining and embedded within their Stone Blocks.
On theWindows Phoneand3DSversions, mining gems also has a chance of yielding aBroken HeartduringValentine's Day.
In descending order of rarity and value (rarest at the top):
A gemstone cave, where higher concentrations of gems can be found. Most of these gems are in placed form, while a few are embedded in Stone.
Two gemstone caves, with walls reflecting the gems found in each.
A gemstone cave is a rare, irregularly shaped room often found in theCavernlayer. It contains a high concentration of placed gems on multiple stone surfaces, as well as a few gems embedded in stone. Most gemstone caves contain one or two types of gemstone, but can rarely contain three or more types. The type of gem found in such caves is easily identifiable by theGem Wallthe cave utilizes, but this wall cannot be collected to obtain any items."
Glowing_Mushroom_biome,"AGlowing Mushroom biome, also known asGlowing Mushroom Fields, is abiomecharacterized byMushroom grass,Glowing Mushrooms, andGiant Glowing Mushroomsgrowing onMud Blocks. The grasses and plants in a Glowing Mushroom biome emit a vibrant blue glow, along with many of its uniqueenemies. TheTruffleNPCrequires ahousein aSurface(above-ground) Glowing Mushroom biome and sells mushroom-themed blocks, pets, weapons, and vanity items.
The Underground Glowing Mushroom biome.
Underground Glowing Mushroom biomesare Glowing Mushroom biomes below 0depth. They can be found naturally, randomly generating on world creation. The background of an Underground Glowing Mushroom biome depicts numerous small mushrooms. Several mushroom-themed versions of normalCavernenemies spawn here inpre-Hardmode, and some completely unique enemies will spawn inHardmode. Giant Glowing Mushrooms will grow if there is enough vertical space,though unlike Giant Glowing Mushrooms on the surface, they have smaller caps and lack branches. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, Underground Glowing Mushroom biomes are large, layered caverns which featureMushroom Vineshanging from the ceiling and surface-style Giant Glowing Mushrooms. They generate with set features, including a span of flat ground (for Giant Glowing Mushrooms to grow on), or possibly a wide lake forfishingpurposes. These long spans of flat ground are vital to the spawning ofGold Chests, statues, and other objects which generate underground but rely on having a certain amount of level terrain likeLife Crystals, making these biomes attractive when hunting for such things.
Surface Glowing Mushroom biomesare Glowing Mushroom biomes above 0depth. They do not generate naturally and must instead be created by the player. After placing 100 mushroom-related tiles, the biome background will appear, which depicts towering mushrooms. When the biome reaches a size of 160 mushroom-related tiles, the sky will be darkened. There are several exclusive enemies, some of which can also be encountered in Underground Glowing Mushroom biomes.
A Glowing Mushroom biome can be created manually by plantingMushroom Grass Seedson Mud Blocks, or spraying theJunglewith theClentaminatorusingDark Blue Solution. An area requires 100 tiles on the surface or 160 underground that are mushroom-related (Mushroom grass, naturally grown Glowing Mushrooms, Giant Glowing Mushrooms) to be considered a Glowing Mushroom biome[1].
TheTruffle Worm, a critter used to summonDuke Fishron, can only spawn in an underground Glowing Mushroom biome.

Goblin_Army,"TheGoblin Army(also known as theGoblin Invasion) is aneventwhen unique Goblin enemies spawn in waves. A Goblin Invasion has a random chance of occurring at any particulardawn, if the criteria stated below are met. It can also be triggered manually using aGoblin Battle Standard.
Defeating at least one Goblin Army fulfills the criteria for theGoblin TinkererNPCto make his initial appearance in a randomCavernarea.
The criteria for a Goblin Invasion to occur naturally are as follows:[1]
AGoblin Battle Standardcan be used to manually summon the event if a player meets the health requirement, even if noShadow OrborCrimson Hearthas been smashed.
On average, a random Goblin Invasion will occur about every 12 real-world hours of playing in pre-Hardmode, and every 24 hours of playing in Hardmode.
When a Goblin invasion is approaching, one of the two followingstatus messageswill appear:""A goblin army is approaching from the west!""/""A goblin army is approaching from the east!""
The message repeats a few times (one time on a small- or medium-sized world, and twice on a large-sized world). The direction specified in this message only pertains to the initial wave of Goblins, which spawns at the world's edge and travels to the player's original spawn point. Additional waves spawn immediately near the player's original spawn point, when the player is in that area.
If the message says ""west"", the initial Goblins will come from the left. If the message says ""east"", they will arrive from the right. Note that these directions arenotrelated to the apparent motion of thesunand themoon, which, inTerraria, appear to move from left (""west"") to right (""east"").
When the Goblin Army is about to begin spawning around the player's spawn point, another status message appears:""A goblin army has arrived!""and the thememusicwill switch to the""Goblin Invasion"" /""Boss 1"" track.
The event is completed when the player defeats all goblins in the army.
The size of the army is based on the number of players currently in the world, and their health capacity:
This means that in single player, the army will consist of 120 goblins, while in an8-player game, with each player having 200 health or more, it will spawn 400 goblins. The maximum number of goblins in an invasion is 10,280 (255 players above 200 health).
When the final wave of goblins is on the screen, the status message""A goblin army has been defeated!""will appear; and goblins will stop spawning. Even after the message is displayed, the event theme will keep playing until the last remaining goblin is dead.
These goblin characters are not part of the Goblin Invasion:"
Goblin_Tinkerer,"TheGoblin Tinkereris anNPCthat sells several unique items, as well as providing theReforgefunction. He can be acquired after aGoblin Armyhas been defeated, spawning randomly in open areas in theCavernlayer (Underground layer in theDon't Dig UpandEverythingseeds.) He will appear to be bound at first, and like theMechanic,Wizard,Golfer,Tavernkeep,Angler, andStylist, talking to him in this state will free him. He will then respawn as long as a vacantHouseis available.
The Goblin Tinkerer's reforge option allows the player to randomize theModifierfor aweaponoraccessory, which can make the item better or worse than it was originally. Reforges cost one-third of the item's currentvalue, which can also be affected by its current modifier. The reforge cost is also affected by the Goblin Tinkerer'sHappiness, and can be decreased by equipping aDiscount CardorGreedy Ring.[2]
The modifiers of items used in crafting have no effect on the crafted item's modifier. Any modifier given to the newly crafted item will be completely random.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionwhen threatened by enemies, the Goblin Tinkerer will defend himself by throwingSpiky Balls, which behave like those thrown by the player and deal 15 /22/26damage at the start of the game, and (on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version) as players progress he will gainvarious stat increases.[1]
The Goblin Tinkerer prefers to live in theCavernlayer, or with theMechanic.
The Bound Goblin is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.

Golem,"Golemis aHardmode, post-Planterabossfound in theJungle Templeand is by far one of the easiest bosses in the game relative to game progression.
While Golem is alive, the musicGolemhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Golem.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
Golem is summoned by using the Lihzahrd Power Cell⚷Interacton theLihzahrd Altar, located in the finalJungle Templechamber, while at least oneLihzahrd Power Cellis in the player's inventory. A Lihzahrd Power Cell is contained within each of the Jungle Temple'sLihzahrd Chests, and can be dropped rarely byLihzahrdsorFlying Snakes(2*1/50 (2%)chance). Golem spawns directly above the Altar.Planteramust have already been defeated at least once in the current world in order for Golem to spawn successfully. Otherwise, nothing will happen and the power cell will not be consumed. Because of this, to fight Golem in a brand new world, the player is required to killPlantera, the threemechanical bosses, and theWall of Fleshat least once.
While Golem's main body can not normally pass through blocks, its fists, lasers, and head (when detached in the second phase) can. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, if the body's path to the player is blocked, it will leap on the player, allowing it to pass through all barriers (similar to the behavior of abiome mimic).
Golem shoots ricocheting fireballs, attacks with its unstoppable fists that extend from chains, and jumps around. These increase in frequency as each part takes more damage. Golem's fists can travel through blocks, but have limited range. In addition, his fists will also glow when they are about to extend—they will extend 0.5 seconds after glowing. Golem jumps around more often when a fist is destroyed. This compounds when both fists are destroyed.
When the head falls below half health (12500 /18750/23906), all previous attacks continue, but the eyes will begin to fire eye lasers that can travel through blocks. It fires more rapidly as it takes more damage. Golem's head turns, which indicates who it is targeting.
When Golem's stone head has taken full damage, it detaches itself and becomes invincible, capable of passing through blocks. Its body (15000/22500/28687health) then becomes the target. If the fists have not been destroyed, they will continue to attack the player more rapidly while the body continues to jump around. The head follows same attack pattern as before and will increase in frequency when the body is damaged. The only way to defeat Golem at this point is to completely destroy his body, which will also destroy his head, ending the fight.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, Golem becomes ""enraged"" if it has to follow the player outside of theUnderground Jungle, either through being lead or awoken outside of it. This causes Golem to jump around faster and, if its head is below half health, it will fire his lasers faster. However, it does not have increased damage or defense. Golem will return to its normal behavior when returned to the Underground Jungle.
Unlike Plantera, Golem's enraged behavior is not noticeable until reaching the end of its first form, when it begins jumping around and firing lasers at a faster rate. Furthermore, the difference between his enraged and normal behavior will not be noticeable to most without deliberately switching between the two.

Golf,"Golfis an in-game activity whereplayershitGolf BallsintoGolf CupsusingGolf Clubs. Golf supplies can be purchased from theGolferNPC. Golf courses are not naturally-occurring and must be built.
Placement of the cup.
The player needs to obtain the following basic components to build their course: aGolf Ballof any color, anyGolf Club, aGolf Cup, and aGolf Teeto place the ball.
To play golf, the player should either place a Golf Tee and then put a ball on it by pressing⚷Interacton the tee, or just drop the ball on the ground. Then, they should use one of the four types of clubs to hit it, those being the Driver, the Iron, the Wedge, and the Putter. The goal is to get the ball into the hole in as few hits or ""strokes"" as possible. Using theGolf Whistlewill return the ball to its previous position with a one-stroke penalty.
Separate from the regular golf scoring system of stroke count,golf scoreis a statistic used to track a character's overall experience with playing golf. The golf score is calculated based on the number of strokes used and the total of theEuclidean distancesof each shot. That is, by drawing a straight line between each location a shot is taken, and where the ball subsequently lands, the total distance will be the total length of all those lines, measured in feet. The calculated score is then rounded down before being added to the character's accumulated score. The exact score before rounding is calculated using the following formula:
score = (total distance / 16) / (strokes + 2)
A player can accumulate a maximum total score of 1,000,000,000.[1]TheGolfer's shop inventory will expand as the player increases their total score, but will not expand after 2000. The availability of some of his quotes is also tied to the player's golf score. In addition, reaching certain golf score thresholds unlocks theFootballin theParty Girl's shop and theHunter Cloakin theClothier's shop."
Golfer,"TheGolferis anNPCvendor that sellsgolfing-related items. More items will unlock as the player plays more golf, includingclubs,trophies, andpaintings. He spawns in theUnderground Desert, playing golf with himself. Talking to him will ""free"" him, after which he will respawn as long as a vacanthouseis available, even if killed.
The Golfer will attack nearbyenemieswith his golf balls to defend himself.
He is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.

Guide,"TheGuideis usually the firstNPCa player encounters. He spawns near the player when the world is created. He provides tips mainly aimed at new players and displays allcrafting recipes(including thecrafting stationrequired) an item shown to him is used in.
Unlike most other NPCs, the Guide spawns upon world creation, before ahouseis available. He will, however, move into the first house built. If he is killed, a proper house will need to be built before he can respawn, but has no additional requirements.

TheBestiaryentry for the Guide:""The Guide always offers useful advice and crafting recipes. His origins and unusual connections to this world remain a mystery."""
Hardmode,"Initial Hardmode map of a small world on thePC version. Notice the ""V"" made of the new outburst ofCorruption(dark purple) andHallow(pale pink)biomes, which each replace existing world blocks upon the defeat of theWall of Flesh.
Hardmode (not to be confused with hardcore mode), as its name suggests, is essentially a more difficult version of theinitial world. A world permanently converts to Hardmode after theWall of Fleshbossis defeated for the first time. Hardmode grants players new challenges and gives them much more content to explore.
Hardmode adds two newbiomesto the world that will appear and function upon converting:The Hallowand theUnderground Hallow. Along withThe Corruption,The Crimson, and their Underground versions, they willspreadcontinuously and at a steady pace in Hardmode. They may eventually overtake the entire world if notdealt with properly.
At this point,DemonandCrimson Altarscan be broken with thePwnhammer, which drops from the Wall of Flesh. Upon doing so, neworesbecome available to start the player off in Hardmode.
Prior to version 1.4.4, destroying an altar had a 66% chance of converting a single random Stone Block in the Cavern layer intoEbonstone/CrimstoneorPearlstone, facilitating the spread ofUnderground HalloworCorruption/Crimson. No block other than the selected one will be converted initially. As of version 1.4.4 altars no longer spawn random blocks of infestation when broken.
Along with the regularenemies, Hardmode contains new enemies that are more difficult, some of which are""upgraded"" versions of pre-Hardmode enemies.
Hardmode also makes available newarmorsets,weapons,accessories, and other various items that will aid the player and are essential to dealing with new challenges. Some of these become available for purchase fromNPCs,dropfrom enemies, or are craftable using new Hardmodecrafting materialsandcrafting stations.
On theNintendo3DSversion, when the Wall of Flesh is defeated, a pop-up box will briefly appear describing Hardmode while the world is being converted.
Defeating theWall of Fleshfor the first time triggers""The ancient spirits of light and dark have been released.""This refers to the creation of the Hardmodebiomesthat are released into the world. In a ""burst"" ofCorruption/Crimson, two diagonal stripes of the new biomes generate, replacing large sections of the world in a ""V"" pattern that extends from the center ofThe Underworldto the surface. The biomes created are:
The direction of Hallow/Corruption/Crimson biomes is random, but its position is determined byWorld Seed.
TheUnderground CorruptionandUnderground Crimsonprimarily replaceStone Blocks,Ice BlocksandSandon their path with their respective evil versions immediately upon conversion.Underground Junglebiomes do not generally contain these specific blocks in significant amounts and are therefore not replaced.
TheUnderground CorruptionandUnderground Crimsonhave the same themes as the surface Corruption/Crimson, though these biomes contain several new themedenemiesthat can only be found underground, as well as a noticeable change of backgroundmusic.
The Hallowrepresents a brand-new theme, distinguished by its pastel-colored fairy tale imagery. Rainbows make up the surface's background image, itstreesare puffy and multicolored, and enemies look similarly whimsical, such as theUnicornandPixie. However, this quickly proves to be misleading, as Hallow enemies are quick, resilient, and deadly, so players must proceed with caution. The Underground Hallow acts similarly to the surface Hallow in enemy function. There are, however, several unique enemies and a change in background music which sets it apart from the surface.
The Underground Hallow also featuresGelatin Crystals, which areboss-summoning items that spawn theQueen Slime.
While Corruption and Crimson don't spread quickly in pre-Hardmode, they spread much faster and more aggressively in Hardmode. In addition to the evil biomes, the Hallow spreads actively as well.
And, It can spreadJungle(Underground Jungleneither) biome in Hardmode.Remember that every altar you break replaces a random stone block with corruption or crimson.
Given enough time, these biomes might reach the player's home base, hence it is advisable to take steps to protect any areas a player wants to invest time in keeping around. SeeGuide:Maintaining world purityfor further information.
TheWall of Fleshalways drops thePwnhammerupon its defeat. This enables destroyingAltars(as that requires a Pwnhammer or superior hammer) in order to begin progress into Hardmode.This content is transcluded fromAltars.
Players will be able to find these new ores scattered across the Undergroundlayerto near-Underworldlevels, with them replacing most blocks created during world generation. They will spawn at random locations in varying quantity, in places explored and unexplored alike.
All six Hardmode ores and their bars can also be obtained via openingcrates. With an ample supply, this can render destroying altars obsolete entirely.
Hardmode ores and bars can also be obtained from Hardmode crates, which can be fished up during Hardmode. Note that Pre-Hardmode crates that are opened during Hardmode will not drop Hardmode materials.
Hallowed Barsare bars solely dropped by the threemechanical bosses. They are one of three types of bars not crafted by ore, alongsideSpectreandShroomitebars, and Hallowed Bars are the only bars without a crafting recipe.
Chlorophyte Orestarts spawning in theUnderground Jungleupon entering Hardmode. It can be mined with either theDrax,Pickaxe Axe, or stronger. To craft the Drax or Pickaxe Axe, the player needs Hallowed Bars and at least onesoulfrom each of the three mechanical bosses. On theNintendo3DSversion, the Drax can be found inShadow Chests.
Unlike other ores, Chlorophyte Ore is special in that it can convert adjacentMud Blocksinto Chlorophyte Ore, and chunks can become rather large. Chlorophyte Ore can be ""replanted"" and artificially seeded in Mud Blocks at any depth, allowing the player to farm Chlorophyte Ore.
After Plantera's defeat,Chlorophyte Barscan be crafted intoShroomite Barswith anAutohammer, which can be bought from theTruffle, or intoSpectre Barswith anAdamantite/Titanium Forge, requiringEctoplasmfrom theDungeon.
Luminiteis dropped byMoon Lord. TheLuminite Barsmade out of it (at theAncient Manipulator) can be crafted into endgame items, most of them also requiringLunar Fragmentsdropped by theCelestial Pillars.
Allpre-Hardmode bossescan be summoned in Hardmode.
This boss shares many similarities with itspre-HardmodecounterpartKing Slime. The boss is a semi-translucent pink slime with aCrystal Shardcore.
The threemechanical bossesare essentially much stronger versions of their respective pre-Hardmode boss.
Once a world enters Hardmode and at least oneAltaris destroyed, there is a 10% chance every night that one of these mechanical bosses will spawn, as long as they have not been killed in that world before.
Once any single mechanical boss has been defeated for the first time, several new items become available,most notablyLife Fruitwhich start growing in theUnderground Jungle.
After all three mechanical bosses are defeated, a message will appear saying:""The jungle grows restless...""This indicates thatPlanterais now available for summoning:
Plantera's defeat will be accompanied by the status message""Screams are echoing from the dungeon...""The world now undergoes a minor transformation, allowing access to various new events:
TheEmpress of Lightis an optional gap betweenPlanteraandGolem, and is one of the twohallowedbosses featured in the game.
Plantera will always drop aTemple Keyupon defeat. This unlocks theLihzahrd Temple, and inside,Golembecomes available to fight.
WhileDuke Fishroncan be fought as soon as Hardmode is initiated, he is incomparably more powerful and will generally require post-Golem gear.
TheLunatic Cultistis summoned by killing theCultiststhat spawn at theDungeon's entrance after Golem is defeated. Defeating it initiates theLunar Events.
Moon Lordis considered the final boss of thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionofTerraria. He spawns after a short delay after completing theLunar Events, i.e. destroying all fourCelestial Pillars. He can also be manually summoned by using aCelestial Sigil.
Most of the new enemies are significantly more difficult to defeat, dealing more damage and having higher health and defense than pre-Hardmode enemies. Most pre-Hardmode weapons will prove ineffective, and until a player can obtain new Hardmode gear, they may be forced to avoid enemy swarms and/or play more strategically. Slow-hitting powerful weapons with highknockbackare generally preferable over fast weapons with low base damage because many Hardmode enemies have high defense.
InExpert Mode, most pre-Hardmode enemies receive significant stat buffs when entering Hardmode (e.g. aBlue Slime's health will increase from 50 to 274). Some Hardmode enemies can kill a player in 5–6 hits. Similarly, in Master Mode enemies will also gain a drastic buff (Eg. Blue slimes will have 411 health).
However, not all biomes are immediately buffed with more powerful enemies.The Underworlddoes not receive any stronger enemies until after a mechanical boss is defeated, and theDungeondoes not receive additional enemies until afterPlanterais defeated. Therefore, these are viable areas to look for theWizard(and theGoblin TinkererandTavernkeepif you have not unlocked them yet) because of their lack of new enemies to have to deal with early on.
Several newNPCsbecome available in Hardmode:
There are several neweventsin Hardmode, each containing unique and powerful monsters that will spawn in vast numbers and drop a variety of exclusive items.
In Hardmode worlds,Goblin Armiesdo still invade, andMeteoritesstill land, each at their regular rates.Blood Moons,Rain, andSlime Rainalso occur just as frequently as they did pre-Hardmode, though occasionally feature Hardmode-exclusive content.
Several newtools,weapons,accessories,armor, andcrafting materialsbecome available in Hardmode, as enemy drops, sold from NPCs, or via crafting.Drills,chainsaws, andrepeatersare variations ofpickaxes,axes, andbows, respectively, which can be obtained once in Hardmode.
Each of the earlier Hardmode ores has its own complete item set, including armor, drill, chainsaw,sword,spear, andrepeater.
Many of the Hardmode armor sets have three different options for the helmet slot, each of which benefits players that use eithermagic weapons,melee weapons, orranged weapons. The Chlorophyte-derived armors are exceptions:Shroomite armorbenefits ranged weapons in all cases (and requires further specification on eitherarrows,bullets, orrockets),TurtleandBeetle armorbenefit melee weapons, andSpectre armorbenefits magic.
The ""Setting hard mode"" screen on thePC version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version."
Health,"Healthis the character's life count, represented by a meter of heart icons at the top-right of the screen. Each red heart shown represents 20 health, and eachgold heartrepresents 25 health.
Takingdamagecauses health to drop, signified by the meter fading from right to left.Health regenerateswhen the character stops taking damage, and occurs at ever-increasing rates the longer the character avoids further damage, with a further rate boost if the character stands still. Regeneration can also be boosted using various equipable items, potions, and placed furniture items that cause area-effectbuffs(Heart Lantern,Campfire).
New characters begin with 5 red hearts, or 100 health. Health capacity can be increased usingLife Crystals, which add a single red heart each to the health meter permanently, increasing health capacity by 20 each. This can be done until the health meter reaches 20 red hearts (400 health).
Later in the game, the character can useLife Fruitto increase the capacity of their hearts by 5 health each, signified by permanently turning the color of each heart gold. With 15 Life Crystals and 20 Life Fruits used, a character can reach 20 gold hearts, which equals 500 health capacity. A further temporary boost to 600 health capacity can be achieved using aLifeforce Potion.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Hearts will decrease in size and fade away if they are ""empty"". On theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version, andNintendo3DSversion, hearts will lose pieces of themselves to reveal a darkened ""empty"" heart. Each red piece represents 5 health, and each gold piece represents 1 1/4 health. The gold hearts are also on a separate layer than the red hearts.
Damage occurs from attacks, environmental hazards, falling, drowning, or bydebuffs. Taking damage causes a brief period of invulnerability while the character visually ""flashes"". When a character's life reaches 0 and all hearts are completely faded,deathoccurs.
For a complete list of things that can reduce health, seecauses of death.
Main articles:DefenseandArmor
By wearing armor and equipping certain accessories, characters can increase their defense which decreases damage taken. In addition to simply decreasing damage, some items can mitigate or eliminate certain forms of damage. All accessories can havemodifiersthat grant up to 4 defense in addition to their other bonuses and functions.
These items are specifically for the purpose of avoiding getting stuck and drowning in water/other liquids.
These accessories are specifically for the purpose of mitigating or negating the effects of falling into lava.
Lost health can be regained in many ways. If the character has access to aNursethen they can ask her to heal them to full by paying her a fee based on how much damage has been taken. There are also several items that can be used to heal the character. The character will automatically start regenerating health after a short period if no damage has been taken, and it will do it faster while standing still.
Most items which heal the player also grant thePotion Sicknessdebuff for 60 seconds(45 with thePhilosopher's StoneorCharm of Myths). While under the effects of this debuff, the player cannot consume other items which grant the debuff.
The following items and buffs increase the player's natural life regeneration. Most increase it by a static amount per second, therefore allowing the player to regenerate health even while being attacked or moving.
Also see theHealth Regenerationpage for the mechanism of the natural healing rate.
The following items heal the player by an amount based on the damage dealt to enemies."
House,"A basic house with the dimensions of 9 (exterior width) × 7 (exterior height).
Ahouse(orhome) is a structure built by the player thattown NPCsrequire in order to spawn, with one house required per NPC. A structure must meet several requirements in order to function as a house (see detailsbelow). The player can check if a structure meets the requirements by using thehousing menu'stop button, labeled with a question mark (""?""). NPCs generally retreat to their houses atnightand remain in them until dawn. They will also retreat to their houses when itrainsand during null anyevent.
TheGuidewill appear upon starting a new world, and if killed, he will require a house in order to respawn. TheOld Man, theTraveling Merchant, and theSkeleton Merchantdo not require houses.
Similarly, the Guide,Angler,Goblin Tinkerer,Tavernkeep,Mechanic,Stylist,Wizard,Tax Collector, andGolferwill each make their initial appearances regardless of available housing. Once initially found, each will require a suitable house before respawning.
Certain naturally-generated structures can serve as houses and may inadvertently attract NPCs if players have placedlight sourceswithin them. These can includeFloating Islandstructures,Living Treetreasure rooms, and the structures inThe Underworld. NPCs can be moved from these to the player's structures using the housing menu.
The requirements for a player-selectedBedto work as aspawn pointare similar to those for NPC housing, but weaker; players do not need furniture beyond the Bed. See theBedspage for full details.
The housing menu allows managing the placement of NPCs. It is accessed by pressing the small house button above the armor slots in theinventory. The player can check whether a given house is suitable forNPCuse or not, as well as manually appoint a house to a specific NPC.
To check whether a house is suitable for use, press the⚒Use / Attackbutton on the ""?"" housing query mark and then press again anywhere inside the house. Astatus messageindicating whether the house is suitable or not will be displayed. If it is not suitable, the game will show what the house is lacking. This alert prioritizes walls (both fore and background), thenfurniture(door,light source,table, andchair). A generic""This is not valid housing.""can indicate that the frame is not closed, or that there is no place for the NPC to stand (seebelowfor details).
Once a house is determined to be suitable, the player may assign an NPC to it by placing the correspondingNPC flagin it. Only the flags of existing NPCs will appear in the housing menu. For example, when first entering a new world, only the Guide's NPC flag is shown, and the NPC flags for other NPCs will only be shown when they have spawned in the world. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, NPC flags have two different appearances: solid red and red with a golden frame. NPCs that move in by their own will have a regular red flag. If they are assigned to a house, the banner will have a golden frame. This indicates that if the NPC currently inhabiting the home were to die, the replacement for that NPC would move into that specified home.
In theOld-gen console version, the housing menu can be opened by pressingInventoryand navigating to the housing menu. To check whether a house is valid, pressQuick Buffand the housing status of the house the player is standing in will be printed in chat. PressInventoryto show/hide room flags.
There is no housing menu on theNintendo3DSversion.
When the player first meets the spawn conditions for an NPC, a random house will be assigned to them from existing emptysuitablehouses.

The house validity evaluation can be divided into 3 phases: Frame, furniture, and properties.
In this phase, the game will try to determine the frame and the internal area of a house, and complete several checks to its structure.[1]The range of a house includes a ""connected"" internal area and the ""frame"" surrounding it, in details:
All tiles within the range of a house have to meet the following requirements:
A miniature 3×10 house.
A simple, valid house.
Given the minimum size of 60 tiles including the frame, a rectangular house must have at least one of the following dimensions:
Note that a house does not need to be rectangular. The dimensions above are merely examples.
In this phase, the game will check for pieces offurnitureinside the house.
In the range of a house, there must be at least one validlight source, one valid flat-surface item, one valid comfort item, and one valid entrance.[5]The smallest and most easily obtainable objects that meet the requirements are aTorch, aWork Bench, aChair, and twoWood Platforms. See below for list of all eligible items.[6]
Any item with aTile IDof 4, 33, 34, 35, 42, 49, 92, 93, 95, 98, 100, 149, 173, 174, 270, 271, 316, 317, 318, 372, 405, 572, or 592:
Any item with aTile IDof 14, 18, 87, 88, 90, 101, 354, 355, 464, 469, or 487:
Any item with aTile IDof 15, 79, 89, 102, 469, 487, or 497:
Any item with aTile IDof 10, 11, 19, 386, 387, 388, 389, 427, 435, 436, 437, 438, or 439:
In this phase, the house looks structurally valid, but there are three reasons it can still be rejected: If it is already occupied, if it is too close to or inside anevil biome, or if there is no place inside for the NPC to stand at night.
First, the game checks if the house is already occupied by another NPC. If it is, then the house is invalid and thestatus message""This housing is already occupied.""will be displayed.
Otherwise, two properties of the house are checked to determine whether it is a valid house: one is the ""evil score"", the other is the ""home tile score"".[7]
Then, start calculating the evil score.
If the evil score is at least 50, then the house is invalid, and the message""This housing is corrupted.""will be displayed, and if Evil score ≥ 300, the message""This is not valid housing.""will be displayed instead. If an occupied house becomes Corrupted/Crimson, theNPCliving there may move out and wander the area until a new house becomes available.
If the evil score is lower than 50, calculate a ""temporary score"" ( = 50 − evil score). This score will be used in home tile score calculations.
Then, start to check whether there is a valid ""home tile"" within the house. A home tile is a tile which meets the following requirements; in the image, the purple block represents a candidate for the home tile.
Example of areas to be checked.
If there is a tile that meets these requirements, calculate the ""home tile score"" using the objects in the 5×4 area directly above it (red, white, yellow tiles), combined with the temporary score (got from evil score calculations):
If the home tile score is 0 or lower, then the tile is invalid.
If the home tile score is greater than 0, then continue to the second calculation:
There has to be at least one valid home tile in a house to serve as the standing point of NPCs, otherwise the message""This is not valid housing.""will be displayed. TheNPC flagwill hang directly above the standing point. If there are multiple valid home tiles, then the tile with highest score and being nearest to the top left corner of the house will be selected[11]
TheTruffleNPC has an extra requirement for his house: It must have at least 100 tiles ofGlowing Mushroom biomeblocks in the area around it. This area is the same size asthe area used for calculating the evil score.
Two examples of houses with no empty wall. NPCs cannot move into these houses on their own, and must be assigned by a player.
An infinite house. It no longer works as of1.3.1, but it should still work for theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version, andNintendo3DSversion.

Ice_biome,"TheIce biome, also known as theUnderground TundraorUnderground Snow biome, is abiomethat is the underground version of theSnow biome, starting at theCavernlayerand stopping at thelavalayer. On theWindows Phone versionandNintendo3DSversion, the Ice biome starts at theUndergroundlayer. It is composed mainly ofSnow BlocksandIce Blocks.Thin Icecan be found generated overwaterand breaks when a character falls over 4 tiles onto it (unless using theIce Skatesor anotheraccessorycrafted from them). The Ice biome is the only place whereFrozen Chests(Ice Chests) can be found naturally.

Items,"Itemsare entities that are among the most basic components ofTerraria. There are 5000+ items within the game; specifically 5455 items. The player can interact with most items by using, consuming, or placing them. Items are always in one of two forms: ""dropped"", i.e. being part of theworld, or in aninventorypertaining to a player,NPC vendor, orstorage item. Dropped items can usually be picked up by the player to move them into their inventory, and they can usually be dropped out of the inventory again.
Most items can be grouped based on certain shared characteristics, e.g.armoritems,blocks, orweapons. SeeCategory:Itemsfor the complete categorization.
Items can be obtained in numerous ways inTerraria. They can be
When an item is in its ""dropped"" form, any player making contact with the item will pick it up, automatically placing it in their inventory (if there is sufficient space). In addition, all players draw (""pull"") all items within a certain range towards them in order to make contact with them. This range is referred to aspickup range. It consists of a rectangular area of, by default, 5.25×5.25 tiles, centered on the player. Certain effects increase the pickup range for certain items:[1]
Life Booster
Damage Booster
Mana Booster
Gold Ring
Coin Ring
Greedy Ring
Copper Coin
Silver Coin
Gold Coin
Platinum Coin
Celestial Magnet
Celestial Emblem
Celestial Cuffs
Magnet Flower
Star
Soul Cake
Sugar Plum
Heart
Candy Apple
Candy Cane
Treasure Magnet
Hand Of Creation
Effects/equipped items in the same row do not stack.
""Pulled"" items have an acceleration and maximum speed, hence it is possible that an item is not pulled in completely, e.g. if the player is moving very fast and causes it to be out of pickup range before they could make contact with it.
In aninventory, items can be stacked in a single slot to a certain limit.
Most items can stack up to 9999, with a few exceptions (such as equipment andquest fish).
The limits are different for different types of items.
These tables provide a general overview and there are exceptions. See an item's individual page for its maximum stack size.
Items that are in the ""dropped"" state will disappear (""despawn"") upon exiting the world. At that point, it is impossible to reacquire them. If there are more than 400 ""dropped"" items on the world, items will also start despawning. In this instance, the items that have remained dropped for the longest amount of time may vanish as new items are added to the screen.
While only some items can be purchased fromNPC vendors, all items can be sold (very common items such asDirtandWoodhave no value). The base buy and sell values are listed on each item page.
All NPC vendors offer the same base buy and sell value, however prices can be decreased by equipping aDiscount Card, which is a rare drop fromPirate Invasions.Buy and sell values can also be higher or lower based on the NPC'shappiness level.
Hovering over an item in the NPC's shop inventory will display the buy value. Hovering over an item in the player's inventory while the NPC's inventory screen is open will display its sell value. Items are always sold to vendors at 1/5 of their purchase price. Not all items have a sell value. Sales to (and purchases from) NPCs can be cancelled while the NPC's inventory screen is still open: Sold items can be taken back in exchange for the amount they were sold for (and purchased items can be sold back in exchange for the amount they were purchased for).

Journey_Mode,"Journey Modecan be selected upon creation of new characters andworlds. It allows the player a wide array of customization options during gameplay, including duplication of items, modification oftimeand weather, anddifficultysliders. Journey mode is only accessible with Journey characters in Journey worlds (Journey worlds can only be accessed using Journey characters, and Journey characters can only play in Journey worlds).
Journey Mode is intended to beTerraria's""creative"" or ""tourist"" mode, making it relatively easy to acquire items and exploreTerraria'svarious elements and mechanics without having to overcome its normal progression of challenges; though Journey players do have the ability to adjust the game's difficulty on-the-fly to challenge themselves and test different difficulty levels.
ThePower Menucan be accessed via the toggle button located under the maininventoryslots, above the crafting menu. Its interface replaces the crafting menu when opened.
The Power Menu contains seven different functions: Duplication, Research, Time, Weather, Personal Power Menu, Infection Spread, and Enemy Difficulty.
Duplication Menu
This menu allows the player to instantly duplicate any previously researched item indefinitely. The menu has eleven tabs, each for a different item category (Weapons,Armor,Vanity,Blocks,Furniture,Accessories, Equipment,Consumables,Tools,Materials, Miscellaneous). Clicking a category tab shows only items of that type; clicking the same category tab again deselects it.
The search bar lets players search for specific items. When searching for an item, if a category tab is open, it will only search through items in that category. The search bar also has a button at the end of it to clear any text inside it.
Research Box
To duplicate an item, it must first be ""researched"" a certain number of times, which destroys the item in the process. Highlighting an item in the inventory, or placing it into the empty space in the Research Menu, displays a counter of how many more of that item will be required to complete its research. Research counters are tied to characters, meaning that new characters will have to research items again.
The total number of researched items required varies by the item type:
There are three options available within the Time Menu:
The Weather Menu grants the player full control over the current weather:
The Personal Power Menu includes three options related to the player:
A toggle that can stop thespreadofCorruption,Crimson, andHallow. It does not, however, reset them to their original biome.
A slider that sets difficulty anywhere from 0.5× to 3× the normal difficulty. 0.5× equates to the default Journey Mode difficulty, moving up throughClassic Modeat 1×,Expert Modeat 2×, andMaster Modeat 3×. Moving the slider enables all rewards obtainable in the chosen difficulty, includingExpert-mode exclusive itemsandMaster-mode exclusive items."
Jungle,"Map view of a Jungle,Underground Jungle, and aJungle Temple.
TheJungleis asurfacebiomecomposed primarily ofgrass,vines,Mud,Jungle Trees,Bambooand pools ofwater, with a dark green background. Jungle trees grow automatically onJungle grassfound there, though traditionalAcornscan also be planted. TheUnderground Jungleis found just below the Jungle, beginning atcaverndepths.
The Jungle is one of the more challenging surface biomes, especially for those just enteringHardmode. Jungleenemieshave much morehealthand deal moredamagethan those typically found in other surface areas.
Players can seed new Jungle areas by plantingJungle Grass SeedsinMud Blocks. Jungle grass spreads much more slowly than ordinary grass. A Jungle biome will activate once a minimum of 140 Mud Blocks are covered with Jungle grass and/or each square of Jungle Vines, or with 140Lihzahrd Bricks.
The Jungle becomes substantially harder duringHardmode. Additionally, there is a danger that the Jungle can be completely overtaken by the spread ofCorruption/Crimsononce Hardmode has been in effect for some time, making essential Jungle items more difficult to acquire. DefeatingPlanterawill slow down the spread of Corruption/Crimson andHallowto 50% of their original speed inHardmode.
Goblin Scoutscan spawn here rarely, similarly to the forest.

Jungle_Temple,"Map view of a Jungle Temple. The entrance to this one is at the top-left, though it is sometimes at the top-right (it is always near a top corner).
TheJungle Temple(also known as theLihzahrd Temple) is an enclosed structure constructed ofLihzahrd Bricksand located in theUnderground Jungle. It is always present in any generate world, but can only be properly entered afterPlanterahas been defeated. The Jungle Temple contains unique Lihzahrd-themedenemies,traps, andfurniture. TheLihzahrd Furnace, acrafting stationfor further Lihzahrd-themed furniture, can be found in itsChests. TheLihzahrd Altarfound in the Temple's final chamber is used to summon theGolemboss. Defeating Golem triggers the spawning ofCultists, used to summon theLunar Events.
The Temple is entered via theLihzahrd Doorlocated at one of its two top corners. The door is initially locked, requiring aTemple Keyto open, which is dropped by Plantera. Unlocking the door consumes one Temple Key from the player's inventory, and the door remains permanently unlocked for all players in the world. It is generally not possible to enter the Temple via any other conventional means since Lihzahrd Bricks can only be mined with at least thePicksawdropped by Golem, andLihzahrd Brick Wallsimpose numerous restrictions, e.g. onTeleporteruse. There are, however, several methods toenter the temple prior to defeating Plantera.
The Temple's entrance leads to a long corridor that winds downward through several chambers, ending in a large room at the bottom containing theLihzahrd Altar. The Altar can be used to summon Golem at the cost of oneLihzahrd Power Cell. Several Power Cells are found in the Temple's Lihzahrd Chests and are dropped randomly by the Temple'sLihzahrdandFlying Snakeenemies.
The entire Temple is filled with several types oftraps, includingFlame,Spear,Spiked Ball, andSuper Dart Traps. Traps occur much more frequently in the Temple than in theDungeonand are far more damaging. They are activated byLihzahrd Pressure Plates, which only respond to players (enemies walk on them freely without triggering them). As in the Dungeon, all Temple traps, pressure plates, andwirescan be looted by the player for use in player-builtmechanisms."
King_Slime,"King Slimeis apre-Hardmodeboss. His appearance is that of a massiveBlue Slimewearing a jeweled golden crown and having what appears to be a ninja inside of him. He lacks the crown on theOld-gen console,Windows Phone, and3DSversions of the game. As King Slime takes damage, he spawns additional ordinary Blue Slimes (andSpiked SlimesinExpertandMaster Mode) and will also appear to shrink in size.
King Slime spawns under one of the following conditions:
Fighting King Slime is completely optional and not required for game progression, but his defeat may reward the player with money and useful items.
While King Slime is alive, the musicBoss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
King Slime can be summoned manually anywhere and at any time using theSlime Crown.
King Slime has a 1% chance of spawning naturally if the following conditions are met:
If one hundred fiftyslimesare killed by players,lava,traps, and/or summonedminionsduring theSlime Rainevent, King Slime will spawn. Defeating the boss will end the event shortly after – if all players die (even on single player), the boss will despawn and the event will continue for some time before ending on its own (between 9 and 15 in-game hours). If King Slime has already been defeated in a world, it will only take 75 slime kills to spawn him. If King Slime is summoned manually with the Slime Crown and then subsequently killed, while the Slime Rain is active, the event will end in the same way as if the player killed the King Slime that naturally spawns at the end of the event. This can be quite helpful for powerful players who want to get the Slime Rain event over with as quickly as possible.

Knockback,"Knockbackis a basic mechanism inTerraria, whereby players and enemies are repelled in the opposite direction of an attack. Most weapons and environment objects that cause damage also cause knockback, to varying degrees. Some enemies are immune to knockback, particularlyBossesand other enemies that travel through blocks, likeWormsandMan Eaters. Some enemies also have varying degrees of knockback resistance.
Equipping anyShield(with the exception of theShield of Cthulhuand theSquire's Shield) grants the player knockback immunity. Grappling on any surface using anyHookwill also grant the player knockback immunity.Wearing the fullGladiator armorset (dropped byHoplitesfound inMarble Caves) also gives the set bonus of knockback immunity.
The most player-caused/inflicted knockback comes from theSlap Hand, which has a knockback value of 20. This is followed immediately by theShadow Jousting Lancewith a knockback value of 14, then by theHallowed Jousting LanceandTonbogiriwith a knockback value of 13, the regularJousting LanceandGolem Fistwith a knockback value of 12, and theThorns Potion, which retaliates with 10 knockback when its effect triggers.
Knockback is capped at 16 (22.4 if it is aCritical hit). This cap is applied after calculating the enemy's knockback resistance.
Variousmodifiers, and theTitan Gloveaccessoryand its upgrades, can increase player-inflicted knockback.
First, calculating knockback resistance:
Then multiplying knockback by 110% if the target is suffering fromCursed Inferno:
Then apply cap to it if needed:[1]
Then see if it is a Critical hit:
Then apply knockback to velocity, with differing multipliers depending on whether the hit is more than 10% of the targets max health (15% in expert mode), and 1.5x as much vertical velocity if the target is aSnow Flinx. There are additional changes based on whether the enemy has the noGravity flag set.

Luck,"Luckis a hidden statistic that influences the random nature of various activities inTerraria. There are various ways to increase and decrease this statistic, such asbuff potionsandTorchplacement. Players can estimate their luck value by speaking to theWizard.
Luck influences many ofTerraria'srandomly-chosen items and events, such as the chances of item drops, rare enemy and critter spawns, certaintown NPCs' first appearances, or theTraveling Merchant's inventory items.
Luck is impacted byLadybugs, certain types ofTorches, theLuckybuff,Lantern Nights,Garden Gnomes, and throwing coins intoShimmer.
With all positive effects, it is possible to reach a maximum luck value of 1.4, although with no benefit beyond a value of 1. The only factor with a negative effect on luck is from Ladybug luck, making it possible to reach a minimum luck value of −0.4.
The player's interactions withLadybugs,Gold Ladybugs, andtown NPCshave a certain influence on their luck. The following is a simplified summary; see theTechnical detailssection for a more detailed and accurate explanation.
It can be seen that, overall, positive Ladybug luck lasts four times as long as negative Ladybug luck. Ladybug luck is reset to 0 as soon as the player leaves the world.
By default, the player has ""neutral Ladybug luck"", which means that Ladybug luck contributes a value of 0 to the player's overall luck. The player can have ""good Ladybug luck"", in which case the Ladybug luck value is positive, or ""bad Ladybug luck"", in which case the Ladybug luck value is negative. The Ladybug luck value is added to the player's overall luck. Both ""good"" and ""bad Ladybug luck"" are caused by certain actions by the player, are temporary, and have a set duration, and once it elapses, the player has ""neutral Ladybug luck"" again.
The Ladybug luck value depends on the remaining duration of ""good"" or ""bad Ladybug luck"", calculated with the following formula:[1]
ladybug luck=durationsecondsx∗0.2{\displaystyle \text{ladybug luck} = \frac{ \text{duration}_\text{seconds} }{x} * 0.2},
wherex{\displaystyle x}is 720 if the player has ""good Ladybug luck"" and −180 if the player has ""bad Ladybug luck"".
For example, if the player has 4 minutes of ""bad Ladybug luck"" remaining, their Ladybug luck value is −0.267. If they have 42 seconds of ""good Ladybug luck"" remaining, their Ladybug luck value is +0.01167.
There are five events that cause the player to receive a specific duration of ""good"" or ""bad Ladybug luck"":
If the player receives ""good Ladybug luck"" while they have ""bad Ladybug luck"", the duration of the ""bad Ladybug luck"" is canceled immediately and they are granted the full duration of the ""good Ladybug luck"" (and vice versa), with the exception of killing the Guide (which only grants ""good Ladybug luck"" if the player does not already have ""bad Ladybug luck""). If the player receives ""good Ladybug luck"" while they already have ""good Ladybug luck"", then the durations will not be added. Instead, whichever of the two durations is greater will continue to be counted down. The same applies to ""bad Ladybug luck"".
This reveals that the maximum duration of ""good Ladybug luck"" is 24 minutes (granted by touching a Gold Ladybug), which results in an initial Ladybug luck value of1440720∗0.2=+0.4{\textstyle \frac{1440}{720}*0.2 = +0.4}, and that the maximum duration of ""bad Ladybug luck"" is 6 minutes (caused by consuming a Gold Ladybug as bait or killing one at very close range), which results in an initial Ladybug luck value of360−180∗0.2=−0.4{\textstyle \frac{360}{-180}*0.2 = -0.4}. Of course, both of these values are merely momentary. After half a minute (assuming no new Ladybug luck is received in the meantime), both values will have already changed to +0.39167 and −0.367, respectively.
By placing or holdingTorchesin the correct locations, players can increase their luck:
To maximize luck, players should try to use biome Torches underground in their respective biomes, and avoid using the Torches for the wrong biome. They should also avoid using ordinary Torches in any biome which has its own Torch. Bone Torches are useful for biome borders, to avoid standing in one biome with the other biome's Torches in range. On the surface and in Space, players can boost their luck byholdingthe proper Torch; clearly this will not help with fishing or anything else that requires a non-Torch tool. Combat can still be affected defensively and by way of indirect attacks, e.g.minions, sentries, andarmoreffects.
If theTorch God's Favoris toggled on, ordinary Torches are automatically converted to the proper type when held and/or placed in the Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle, Desert and Snow biomes. Bone Torches andDemon Torchescan also be automatically placed in the Dungeon or Underworld respectively, but those still have no effect on luck there. (Bone Torcheswouldgive a bonus in the Underworld.)
TheLuckybuff increases luck based on how much time there is left:
The values do not stack, so using aGreater Luck Potion(which lasts for 15 minutes) will yield +0.3 luck for 10 minutes, then +0.2 luck for 2 minutes, and finally +0.1 luck for 3 minutes. The only difference between the Luck Potions is the duration of the effect.
TheLantern Nightevent increases luck by a value of +0.3. This is active everywhere in the world, even underground. However, a Lantern Night will never start if there is aBlood Moon,Pumpkin Moon,Frost Moon, or any other invasion event active, if anybossis alive, or if theMoon Lordis being summoned.
If there is aGarden Gnomewithin range of the player, their luck will be increased by a value of +0.2. This effect does not stack with multiple gnomes.
ThrowingCoinsintoShimmerconsumes the coin, and increases the player'sCoin Luck. The amount of time that the player's luck is increased is based on the value of coins thrown into the Shimmer.
Using theGalaxy Pearlwill permanently increases a character's luck by 0.03. It cannot be used more than once per character.
TheLucky HorseshoeandLucky Coinwill increase luck by 0.05 each. Their upgrades have the same effect but do not stack with their components.

Luck has a significant impact on multiple random chances throughout the game. Whenever a random chance is rolled in one of the ways listed below, an additional modifier is applied to the chance that the roll has a positive result:[5]
For example, if the base probability of an event is 10%, then:
As an example, for a drop that has a chance of 2% on killing an enemy, if that enemy is killed 1000 times, one would expect 20 of that drop:
With a few exceptions, almost all drop rates of items are affected by luck. The luck of the player closest to the defeated enemy is used for the calculation.
There are several NPC spawn rates that are affected by the player's luck:
A list of mechanics which arenotaffected by luck (including points made above):
TheWizardwill occasionally give the player vague details of what their luck value is, in place of his regular dialogue.

Lunar_Events,"TheLunar Eventsare a series of four late-Hardmodeeventsinitiated by defeating theLunatic Cultistboss. Once the boss is defeated, four different sections of the world each show a large planet in their backgrounds and spawn several unique enemies at high spawn rates, with one correspondingCelestial Pillarin each. These areas can be found on theminimapvia icons that represent each of their Celestial Pillars.
Defeating a Celestial Pillar reverts an area back to normal. In order to damage a pillar, one must first kill 100enemiesfrom within its section, which removes the shield that protects the pillar and makes it vulnerable to attacks. As of 1.4.4, after theMoon Lordis killed a Celestial Pillar will only need 50 kills to remove the shield.
Defeating all four Celestial Pillars triggers thestatus message""Impending doom approaches..."", signifying that theMoon Lord,Terraria's final boss, is about to spawn. It spawns one minute after the message appears."
Lunatic_Cultist,"TheLunatic Cultistis aHardmode, post-Golembosssummoned by killing theCultiststhat spawn at theDungeon's entrance after Golem is defeated. Defeating the Lunatic Cultist initiates theLunar Events.
After all fourCelestial Pillarshave been destroyed, TheMoon Lordwill spawn and the Cultists will respawn at the Dungeon entrance, allowing the player to fight the Lunatic Cultist and initiate the Lunar Events again.
Unlike mostbosses, the Lunatic Cultist does not drop any weapons; however, it does drop theAncient Manipulator, a placeable item that is used to craft many endgame items.
While the Lunatic Cultist is alive, the musicGolemhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Golem.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
The Lunatic Cultist makes its first brief appearance at theMysterious Tabletas soon as the Cultists are defeated. It is not vulnerable to attack at this time. It then warps to just above where the player was when the teleport started, and cycles between three attacks:
When the Lunatic Cultist reaches half health, it will occasionally replace an attack with two spreads of five destructibleAncient Lightprojectiles.
InExpert Modeafter reaching half health, it may also replace an attack with numerousAncient Doomsthat fire four purpleProphecy's Endprojectiles in a cross pattern.
The Lunatic Cultist cycles through five attacks (six when below half health) before proceeding to spawn phantom duplicates of itself calledAncient Cultists, along with a larger version of the Mysterious Tablet via a ""ritual"". Unless the one true Lunatic Cultist is interrupted by an attack from a player during this ritual, the duplicates fly in formation and add their homingShadow Fireballattacks.
Attacking a duplicate or taking too long hitting the real cultist results in the summoning of theWyvern-likePhantasm Dragon. If there is already a Phantasm Dragon inbound, attacking a duplicate triggers anAncient Vision, which will charge the player diagonally. Duplicates can be eliminated by hitting the true Lunatic Cultist during the ritual, but if not, large quantities of duplicates can amass.

Magic,"Magic weaponsareweaponswhich are used in medium- to long-ranged combat. The defining trait of magic weapons is their consumption ofmanaupon every use.
Due to their unusual and unique forms of attack, the majority of magic weapons can hardly be categorized into different types. Note thatminion- and sentry-summoning weapons, which also consume mana, are not considered magic weapons due to the secondary character they spawn and their inability to inflict direct damage.
The following lists present all magic weapons along with their damage and how to acquire them. The intention of this is to convey an idea of their strength and the approximate time during gameplay at which they can be obtained. For a sortable list that displays all statistics of all magic weapons, seeList of magic weapons.





















































































The following items will boost the stats of magic weapons.






































































"
Mana,"Manais a resource consumed by the player when usingmagic weapons. Each magic weapon has a specific mana cost that depletes the player's mana upon use. When a player's mana is depleted completely, a magic weapon cannot be used again until that weapon's mana cost has regenerated.
Similar to playerHealth, the player's current mana supply and capacity are represented by a meter: a column of blue stars displayed on the top-right edge of the screen, with each star representing 20 mana. Mana regenerates automatically as long as the player is not firing a magic weapon. It fills more quickly if the player stands still, with a further rate boost based on the current total mana: The more mana a player has, the faster it regenerates.
Each character starts with 20 mana capacity (one star in the mana meter). UsingMana Crystalsincreases the player's mana capacity by 20 permanently, adding another star to the meter. This can be done up to 9 times, which in addition to the 1 initial star makes 10 stars total, representing 200 mana.
Mana capacity can be increased further through the use of variousarmorssuch as Gem Robes andNebula armor, plusaccessories.Reforgingaccessories to theArcanemodifier can further boost maximum mana.
When mana regeneration has completed and the player again reaches maximum mana, a chirp sound is playedhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:MaxMana.wavand a blue sparkle effect is shown briefly on the character's sprite.
To use magic weapons more often, certain items can increase the maximum mana or reduce the cost of using magic weapons. Because of how mana regeneration works, these can also effectively increase the rate of mana regeneration, so long as the player takes care to remain above certain current mana thresholds.
Mana regenerates on its own when not in use until the player's current maximum is reached.
The natural rate of regeneration is modified by whether or not the player is moving and how much current mana a character has. This formula exists to punish reckless mana use – if all mana is spent, the player will havealmost no regeneration at alluntil they stop moving or use a potion. Conversely, when the player stands still waiting between uses of magical weapons until mana is refilled, mana recovers at its fastest possible rate. Wearing items that increase the maximum mana can thus also increase the rate of recovery, as each use of magic will still leave the player with more remaining mana, and the higher multiplier.
However, mana does not regenerate for a small period after any magic is expended, meaning that to start regenerating mana the player must stop casting spells for a short time. The regeneration cooldown starts the moment the player stops spending mana, so castingMagic MissileandFlamelashwill start the cooldown as soon as it is cast, regardless of how long the projectile is held. Setting upStar Statuesontimerscan help giving magic-using players much better rates of magical fire inboss-fighting or enemy-farming situations where there is time to prepare where the player is going to fight. (ACrystal Ballis also helpful in such situations.)
To be more specific,[1]the mana regeneration has a similar mechanism of health regeneration – there is also a mana counter which is increased by a mana regeneration rate every tick.[2]When it reaches 120 or more, it would be reduced by 120 and increase mana by 1. (So, 1 mana regeneration rate equals to 0.5 mana per second.)
Also, there is a mana regeneration delay, which would be set to a certain number calculated by the formula below (round up after the calculation), if the player used any magic weapons:
It will be reduced by 1 (if moving) or 2 (if standing still) every tick (also an additional 1 per tick if wearing theMana Regeneration Band). Once it reaches 0, the mana regeneration rate would be calculated by the formula below:
If the player is moving:
If the player is standing still:
Note: In both formulae, thebonuswill normally be 0. It would be 25 if the player was wearing the Mana Regeneration Band.
Then, if the player has theMana Regenerationbuff, the mana regeneration delay will be reset to 20 if it is greater than 20, and it would always treat the player as standing still and having maximum mana. So, it would act like this formula:
If a player wants to rely on magical weapons for normal exploration, they should memorize how to best recover mana, even while distracted. To make the most of mana regeneration, the player should practice understanding the timing between when they fire, and when the tone that indicates they have recovered full mana occurs, (so that they fire their next attack at exactly that moment,) and try to remain stationary during times when the mana recovery starts. Firing can be practiced in a safe location like the player'shomeuntil they are comfortable with how they regenerate their mana.
Several items can be used to regenerate mana:"
Map_viewers,"Map viewersare 3rd-party programs that analyze saved maps and display their contents in one easily-viewable graphic.
Map viewers are useful for findingFloating Islandsand other resources, as well as providing a total world view not otherwise attainable. Some programs also provide advanced tools for checking map variables, checkingChestcontents, and even altering maps in various ways.


A powerful map editor and viewer for Windows. Its countless features can be used to copy naturally generated structures or cleanse theEvil Biome, for example.




TerraMap lets you pan and zoom around in an interactive map and dynamically highlight items, items in chests, dungeons, NPCs, etc. It also supports headless, unattended world map image generation via command-line, complete with highlight capability.
An alternate version,TerraMap Online, is a web app version of TerraMap that lets you use all its features from an in-browser interface.



Pan and zoom maps with full game textures and lighting applied (textures require a local Terraria installation). Inspect chests and signs with right-click. Quickly jump to spawn, NPC houses, and Chests containing specific items. A variety of Save options to showcase your creations.
If textures do not display and the ""Use Textures"" option of the ""View"" menu is grayed out, click Help -> Settings, uncheck ""Autodetect Texture Folder"", click ""Browse..."", and locate the\Content\Imagesfolder of your Terraria installation. Close and restart Terrafirma for this setting to take effect.



A cross-platform online web application that lets you edit and view Terraria maps.



Terraria Worlds Viewer is a .NET Framework application capable of loading a Terraria world and display all the existing blocks and liquids inside. By default it uses a 1x zoom, where 1 pixel equals 1 block, but it also includes 2x, 3x and 4x zoom. It also shows the block coordinate where the mouse cursor is, as well as the ID of the block and the block name, and also the ID of the liquid and liquid name. It even shows the world seed. It can export the full world map as .PNG format, even supporting the current zoom level. Also allows to copy the world image and even the world seed. It's a very simple but quick and effective tool to get a full overview of any world or to find any chest, ore or treasure, since it draws the liquids with transparency, allowing to see if there's anything inside of them, as well as several options to filter or remove ores, liquids or walls. Finally the worlds will always be loaded as read-only, so they'll never be modified in any way.



A map viewer that generates .PNGs which can be marked for map features, item locations, andChestscontaining specificitems.



An extensible, open source, tool collection that merges many conveniences of other tools into a GUI. Available in multiple languages, Omnitool creates world backups and maps worlds on launch. It comes with several plugins to provide more uses, and more plugins may be found on the TerrariaOnline forums.
Features:"
Martian_Madness,"Martian Madnessis aHardmode, post-Goleminvasion-styleeventthat includes several alien-themedenemies. It can only be triggered afterGolemhas been defeated.
Martian Madness is triggered by aMartian Probe, which spawns randomly in the two outer lateral thirds of the map (with a higher spawn chance in theSpacelayer). When this small flying enemy detects a player or is attacked, it immediately attempts to fly away. If the Probe escapes, the event starts. This requires at least one player with at least 200 maximumhealthto be in the world – otherwise, the event will not start. AMartian Probewill not spawn if any of the 4Celestial Pillarsare active.
Once triggered, thestatus message""Martians are invading!""appears, and UFOs start flying in the background (as seen in the banner above); though Martian Madness enemies will not actually begin spawning until the player is located near the defaultspawn pointor near anNPCwith valid housing. As with other invasion-style events, a progress bar is shown in the bottom right corner while the event is ongoing. This bar fills as event enemies are defeated. When it reaches 100%, the event ends and Martian enemies stop spawning.
Martian Madness currently features 11 exclusive enemies and one exclusive mini-boss (Martian Saucer), resulting in 11 differentbannersand onetrophy.
Using portals quickly despawns regular invasion enemies in favor of Martian Saucers."
Master_Mode,"Master Modeis an option that can be selected duringworldcreation. It further increases the difficulty of the game beyondExpert Mode, as well as offering Master Mode–exclusive items. Like Expert Mode, Master Mode begins the moment the Master Mode world has been created, and cannot be altered after that by the player. InJourney Mode, Master Mode can be toggled using the difficulty slider.
All Expert Mode changes also apply to Master Mode, including increased drop chances, modifiedAIs, etc. All Expert-exclusive content is available in Master Mode.

Mechanic,"TheMechanicis anNPCwho sells variousmechanisms, as well asWire CuttersandWrenches, allowing the player to construct and activate wired devices liketrapsandcritter engines. She can be found in theDungeonin theCavernlayer or below after killingSkeletron, where she spawns randomly as the stationaryBound Mechanic. Talking to her in this state will free her, after which she will respawn as long as a vacanthouseis available, even if killed.
On thePC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacyversions, the Mechanic will attack nearby enemies. She will throw herCombat Wrench/Wrenchlike aboomerangto defend herself, dealing 11 /16/19damage at the start of the game; on thePC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, as players progress she will gainvarious stat increases.[1]She can drop her weapon upon death.
The Bound Mechanic is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.
When submerged inShimmer, the Mechanic will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again.

Minions,"Summon weaponsare a type ofweaponthat spawns secondary characters that will aid the player during battle by automatically attackingenemieswithin range. They dealsummon damageand cannot be hurt or killed.
The characters spawned by most summon weapons fall into one of two categories:minionsandsentries. Minions are mobile characters that follow the player, while sentries remain stationary. Additionally, the set bonuses of theStardust armor,Chlorophyte armor, andForbidden armorwill summon an entity to fight for the player in a manner similar to minions.
Whipsare related weapons that deal summon damage without summoning any minions. Hitting an enemy with awhipcauses a player's minions and sentries to target it immediately. Some whips have bonus effects which can be activated by minions, but not by sentries.
There are currently 26 summon weapons on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, 19 on theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, 11 on theOld-gen console versionandWindows Phone version, and 5 on theNintendo3DSversion.
Minionsare mobile characters. They follow the player indefinitely until the player: dies, summons a replacement minion, manually cancels theirbuff, or exits the world.  There are several different minions available, some of which can walk or fly, and attack using melee or ranged means. A minion costsmanato summon initially, but follows the player indefinitely thereafter at no further cost.
Minions provide an ongoing source of damage against enemies which requires little or no attention from the player. The common limit of all minions is that each has a limited rate of attack and damage, but the different types also have various limits to their movement and/or attacks.
Minions follow players in a manner similar topets, flying and passing throughblocksas necessary to keep pace with the player's movements, though most cannot move through blocks for the purposes of attacking. Exceptions are the minions summoned byAbigail's Flower,Tempest Staff,Xeno Staff,Desert Tiger Staff,Stardust Dragon Staff,Blade Staff,Sanguine Staff, andTerraprisma, all of which can attack through blocks.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is possible to press⚷Interactwith a minion-summoning item. This will direct the respective minion to target the entity nearest to the cursor. As long as the minions have their target within their line of sight, they will specifically attack it.The targeted enemy will show swirling white curves on it.The targeted enemy will show swirling purple particles which will trail behind a moving enemy, or circle in front of a stationary one (see images).
By default, a player can only have a single minion summoned at once. Various boosts can raise the player's minion capacity (""slots""), allowing multiple simultaneous minions. With minion cap boosts in effect, the same minion can be summoned multiple times, or several different minions can be summoned. Minion cap boosts do not affect pets orlight pets. If the minion cap later drops below the number of minions in use, minions are randomly chosen and dismissed until the number of minions is below the current cap. Minions vanish when their player leaves the world, and are not re-summoned when the player re-enters that or another world.
TheSpider Staff(onOld-gen console,Windows Phone,Old Chinese, andtModLoader Legacy),Optic Staff, Stardust Dragon Staff,Abigail's Flower, andDesert Tiger Staffhave special minion capacity logic. See their pages for details.
Sentriesare stationary characters. Unlike minions, sentries do not follow the player, and will instead remain rooted in place. In normal use, sentries will last for a fixed ten minutes before vanishing; unlike minions, they can persist even after their owner dies. During theOld One's Armyevent, this time limit does not apply (seebelowfor details).
By default, a player can only have a single sentry summoned at once.Tavernkeep armor and Old One's Army accessories (see below) can raise the player's sentry capacity, allowing multiple simultaneous sentries. Note that these accessories donotstack with each other, so the maximum sentry limit is 6: 1 by default, +1 from an accessory, +1 from a War Table, and +3 from armor. With sentry cap boosts in effect, the same sentry can be summoned multiple times, or several different sentries can be summoned. On theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version, andNintendo3DSversion, the player is limited to only summoning one of each sentry type, with no way to raise the cap.
A waiting sentry goes into a reuse cooldown after attacking, before it can try to attack again. This cooldown is bypassed initially on summoning, which can dramatically increase sentry attack speed at the cost of greater mana expense. Since sentries do not suffer fromMana Sickness, this can be a viable way to deliver high damage at long range when using a sentry that attacks instantly.
Sentries summoned by items from theTavernkeepare associated with theOld One's Armyevent. They are purchased withDefender Medals(instead ofcoins), which are awarded only during the event. At first, they can only be used within the event, where they will remain placed until the end of the event. Each sentry summoned will cost 10Etherian Mana; at the beginning of the event, the player immediately gets the 10 Etherian Mana for their first sentry, and can collect more as they kill enemies.  Sentries summoned with Etherian Mana are not subject to sentry limits (see above).  Other sentries can be used in the event, but will have their usual mana cost, duration, and sentry limits.
Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: Rod, Cane, and Staff; with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The Tavernkeep's various armor sets each enhance one of his four sentry types; see his article for full details.
After the event is completed once, these can be used outside the event, and will then function as normal sentries, costing ordinarymanato summon (5 points per tier) and lasting the usual two minutes. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event, so the usual sentry limits apply:  By default only one sentry can be summoned at once, butarmorsold by the Tavernkeep, and accessories dropped by event bosses such asOgres, can raise a player's sentry limit. This limit increasedoesinclude non-Tavernkeep sentries such as the Queen Spider.  Again, the accessories do not stack with each other.
Whipsare unlike other summon weapons, and instead act more like a traditional weapon. When used, whips will perform a normal attack which costs no mana, swiping in a wide cone towards the cursor or wherever aimed. Whips deal summon damage, and as such cannot dealcritical hits. All whips can pierce infinitely in their range, but will deal progressively less damage to each additional enemy they hit, until they start dealing 1 damage. Whips all vary in size as well. The severity of damage loss from piercing and the size of whips typically goes down and up, respectively, as whips get stronger.
Despite being summon weapons, whips are affected by some effects which only work onmelee weapons, only get meleemodifiers, and have a limited range like melee weapons. Whips are affected by any boosts to melee speed (such asFeral Clawsand its upgrades), as well asflasksand theautoswingtoggle feature. Whips are not affected by boosts to melee damage or theTitan Glove's boost to melee weapon size.
A feature of whips is how they make minions and summons target the enemy hit, the same way that other summon weapons can target enemies. Whips can only target enemies by hitting them, unlike those other summon weapons. The enemy targeted will always be the last enemy hit by the whip, usually the furthest enemy away from the player that gets hit.
The main feature of whips is their summon tag damage, which increases the damage of each minion hit by a set amount. Two endgame whips also feature summon tag critical strike chance, which enables summons to deal critical hits. This summon tag critical strike chance cannot be increased by any other boosts to critical strike chance. Summon tag effects will affect both minions and sentries.
Some whips feature uniquebuffsanddebuffs, aside from the common debuffs ofPoisonedandOn Fire!that two whips can inflict. Two whips feature debuffs which activate an effect when the enemy with the debuff is hit by a minion.These two debuffs are also universal; even universally immune enemies likeThe Destroyercan be affected by whip debuffs. The buffs that whips have are mostly boosts to melee speed, which get progressively more potent for stronger, later whips. These melee speed buffs are not exclusive to the whips that grant them, and will actually affect not only other whips, but also melee weapons in general. TheCool Whipcurrently features the only buff that does not affect melee speed; its buff creates a damaging projectile that lasts for 3 seconds after the last time the whip hit something.

The maximum possible minion capacity is 11. It requires equippingStardust armor(not counting its Stardust Guardian), thePapyrus Scarab,Necromantic Scroll, andPygmy Necklaceaccessories while being under the effects of theSummoning Potionand theBewitching Table.
Note that damage is calculated in a two-step process. First the weapon damage itself is adjusted for the weapon modifier (and rounded to the nearest integer). Only after that are all other modifiers added and applied to the weapon damage.
Damage bonuses only need to be active while actually summoning the minions. This allows summoning some minions at maximum damage, and then unequipping some of the damage bonus for limit increases, to summon more minions at slightly lower damage.
Update 1.4.0.1 changes the damage bonus to be calculated concurrently, meaning any damage bonus that is removed while a minion is active will be removed from the minion. Thus, the following loadout is no longer useful as a ""setup"" procedure, though it remains a powerful summoner build.
ARuthless modifieron the minion-summoning staff yields +18% up front.
Other modifiers can be maximized as follows:
Total maximum: +224% (+273%). On top of the bonus for a Ruthless weapon, this will yield approximately +282% (+340%).

In addition, we have the following bug fixes:"
Modifier,"Amodifier, also known as aprefix(although in some languages it becomes a suffix), applies permanent changes to an item's statistics. It changes the name of an item by adding a prefix to the item's name (displayed when selected in thehotbarand in itstooltip), such as ""Adept"", ""Godly"", or ""Broken"" (e.g. ""DemonicMinishark""). A complete list of all eighty-three (83) modifiers can be foundbelow. Hovering the cursor over an item with a modifier in aninventoryslot will show the modification details beneath the item's description.
Most but not all weapons and accessories will receive a modifier upon the item's creation. Modifiers can be added or changed afterwards by theGoblin Tinkerer'sReforgefunction.
Nearly all weapons and accessories have up to a 75%[1]chance of receiving a random modifier upon the item's creation: Naturally generated in aChest,crafted, looted from agrab bag(excludingPresents), or dropped by a slainenemy. Items produced byfishing(e.g.,RockfishorBalloon Pufferfish), opening Presents (e.g.,Candy Cane Sword), and completingAnglerquests (e.g.,Angler Earring) never get initial modifiers, though they can be reforged to gain a modifier.
Items purchased from NPCs never have any modifiers, due to the ability to refund items (selling them back for full price before closing the menu) introduced in1.4.
No modifiers are visible on an NPC's shop stock, but one can be supplied when the item is bought (its purchase price will be unaffected). However, an item that a player sells to an NPC will keep its modifier, and if repurchased in the same trading session, the modifier will be unchanged.
For a weapon's initial modifier, there is a ""mercy"" mechanic that reduces the chance of penalties:[1]If a weapon's initial modifier is one of a list of ""bad"" modifiers, it has a66.67*2/3 (66.67%)chance of being voided, and the item will be created without a modifier. This can sharply reduce the chance of having a modifier at all, but does so by eliminating only bad modifiers. The modifiers considered ""bad"" for this purpose are: Tiny, Terrible, Small, Dull, Unhappy, Awful, Lethargic, Awkward, Inept, Ignorant, Deranged, Broken, Damaged, Weak, Shoddy, Slow, Sluggish, and Lazy. Note that some usually-unwanted modifiers arenotincluded in this ""mercy"" list:  Shameful, Intense, Annoying, and Frenzying.
Accessories do not have any ""bad"" modifiers regardless, only lesser bonuses.
Reforging is a service provided by theGoblin Tinkerer, which applies a new, random modifier to an item in exchange forcoins. It will add a modifier to an unmodified item or replace an existing modifier. It will never leave an item without a modifier. All eligible modifiers have equal chances, without the ""mercy"" filtering of initial modifiers.
The Goblin Tinkerer charges one third of the item's current buyvalue, which is166.67*5/3 (166.67%)of its sell price or33.33*1/3 (33.33%)of its base value. TheDiscount Cardor its upgrade, theGreedy Ring, can be used to lower reforge costs by 20%. Existing modifiers affect an item's value, so items with poor modifiers are cheaper to reforge, while reforging an already well-modified item will be more expensive.The price is adjusted according to the Goblin Tinkerer's currenthappiness.
Reforging can be accessed by talking to the Goblin Tinkerer and choosing ""Reforge"" from the options, then placing the item to be reforged in the box that appears below the inventory. Below the listed cost is a small gray hammerthat, when clicked, reforges the item for the listed price.
In theOld-gen console versionandMobile version, items are reforged by clicking the reforge button after speaking to the Goblin Tinkerer. It will pull up the inventory and highlight items that can be reforged (ones that cannot are hidden by a shadow). Hover the cursor over the item that is to be reforged and press the reforge button.
Accessorymodifiers are only active while the accessory is equipped in a non-vanity slot. Nearly every accessory item can be reforged, with the exceptions of theGuide Voodoo Doll,Clothier Voodoo Doll, and all theMusic Boxes. Unlikeweapons, accessories can only receive beneficial modifiers. Modifiers cannot be legitimately obtained onarmor. Accessories can have one of the following nineteen modifiers attached to them:
The average value boost for all accessory modifiers is +27.75%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +20.81%.
These modifiers only apply when the weapon is being used. Weapons and tools that have no knockback cannot get modifiers that change knockback; examples includedrills, theMagical Harp, and manyguns(such as theMinishark).
The stackable weaponsLight DiscandBananarangcannot have modifiers.
Flails,spears,yoyos,boomerangs,chainsaws,drills(including theDrax) and theChlorophyte Jackhammercan only have universal modifiers, because they cannot have their speed modified.
Universal modifiers can also be found on all other weapon types. The best universal modifier is Godly or Demonic. The two modifiers only differ in knockback, a stat that is not considered very useful (or even beneficial) in many situations. The difference in knockback is also negligible enough that Godly and Demonic can be treated as the same modifier.
Among drills, only theAdamantite Drill,Chlorophyte Drill,Cobalt Drill,Drax,Laser Drill,Mythril Drill,Nebula Drill,Orichalcum Drill,Palladium Drill,Solar Flare Drill,Stardust Drill,Titanium Drill, andVortex Drillcan obtain the Godly modifier, since only these drills have knockback. The best damage-increasing modifier for other drills is Demonic, although it is unlikely that a drill would be of much use in combat.
There are fourteen universal modifiers.
Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.
The average value boost for a random Universal modifier is +17.12%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +12.84%.
Swords(includingShortswords) and all weapons that dealranged,magic, orsummondamage can have these modifiers.
There are ten common modifiers.
The average value boost for Universal and Common modifiers together is +14.75%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +11.06%.
Almost allmelee weaponsthat are swung overhead (swords,pickaxes,hammers,axes, andhamaxes) along withshortswordsandwhipscan be reforged with these modifiers, in addition to common and universal modifiers. With the exception of shortswords (includingStarlight), all melee weapons that are not swung upon use (such asspears,flails, andyoyos) cannot receive these modifiers. TheCopper AxeandWooden Hammercan receive any of these modifiers except for those that affect damage. TheTerrariancannot receive any melee modifiers, though it can gain a special ""Legendary"" modifier that provides different stats.
There are sixteen melee modifiers.
Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.
Counting the Universal and Common modifiers, the average value boost for melee modifiers is +14.93%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +11.20%.
Almost allranged weaponscan be reforged with one of the following modifiers, in addition to common and universal modifiers. Ranged weapons with zero knockback (such as theMinisharkor low-tierbows) cannot receive a modifier that alters knockback, even if their ammunition deals knockback.
There are twelve ranged modifiers.
Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.
Counting the Universal and Common modifiers, the average value boost for ranged modifiers is +21.27%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +15.95%.
Almost allmagic weaponsandsummon weapons(excludingwhips) can be reforged with one of the following modifiers, in addition to common and universal modifiers. Magic or summon weapons with zero knockback (such as theNimbus RodandBlade Staff) cannot receive any modifier that affects knockback. Magic weapons that consume 3 mana or less will not receive any modifier that decreases mana usage.
There are twelve magic modifiers.
Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.
Counting the Universal and Common modifiers, the average value boost for magic modifiers is +20.20%. Accounting for the 25% of items that start with no modifier, the average is +15.15%.
Only swung melee weapons and shortswords can have their size modified. Only ranged weapons can have their velocity modified. Only magic weapons can have their mana cost modified. Certain weapons cannot have their speed, knockback, damage, or mana cost modified.
Displayed values in-game may differ due to rounding.
It is straightforward (but sometimes expensive) to force a given modifier, by reforging the item until it receives the desired modifier. Note that reforging has no ""memory"": Upon each reforge, there is an equal chance of getting any of the modifiers possible for that item, including the modifier it currently has. A casual guess at ""how many tries will it take"" is likely to be misleading, because statistics are tricky: In practice, it is better to consider that at any given moment, there is a 50% chance of getting any specific modifier in a given number of tries:
Being willing to accept more than one modifier will speed things up sharply. For example, if the player accepts either a Lucky or Menacing modifier for boosting their offense, it will take half as much time to reforge compared to reforging the accessory to Menacing specifically. Similarly, if any of three modifiers for a melee weapon will do, there is a 50% chance of getting one of them in only ten tries. Weapon modifiers that are widely considered ""good enough"" include Godly, Demonic, Ruthless, Deadly, and Masterful.
This all applies regardless of how many tries have been made before. The above numbers make no account of modifiers forbidden for individual weapons, but that will just make the process faster.
It is technically possible to make a profit when reforging a weapon once from a bad modifier to a good one, but reforging will normally result in an average monetary loss.
When autopause is enabled, the name of the reforge will not show up above the player's head until the game is unpaused. However, one can get a sense of the modifier's value by looking at the reforge cost, potentially speeding up the process. It is a good idea to check the modifier only when the reforge cost is expensive enough to indicate a potentially good modifier.
For example, anAvenger Emblemwill normally cost1440to reforge if it is Menacing, Lucky, Quick, Violent, or Warding. If aiming for one of those modifiers, one can immediately skip any reforges of lesser value and only check when the displayed cost is1440(remember to account for goblin happiness and discounts).
Similarly, if reforging a sword to Legendary, it is a good idea to make a mental note of how much the weapon costs to reforge when it is Godly/Superior/Demonic, and only stop reforging once the cost exceeds that amount.
Due to various limitations with certain weapon classes, determining the best possible modifiers may not be as simple as comparing statistics, and players can waste money trying to acquire modifiers that are impossible to achieve for their given weapon. The following is an easy rundown of the most desirable possible modifiers for each weapon or weapon type in most situations:
The best overall melee modifier is Legendary, which is only applicable to broadswords andshortswords. The best modifier for all other melee weapons (such asspears,flails,yoyos, and unique melee weapons like theScourge of the Corruptor) is Godly or Demonic. TheTerrariancan obtain a special version of the Legendary modifier unique to it.
The best overall ranged modifier is Unreal. The best modifier for ranged weapons with no base knockback (such as theMinisharkor low-tierbows) is Demonic or Deadly. Although theHarpoonis classified as a ranged weapon, it cannot receive the Unreal modifier; its best modifier is Godly. TheChain Gunfires so quickly that it cannot receive any modifier that increases its speed by 10% or less. As such, its best modifier is Rapid, with Godly and Demonic as more ammo-efficient alternatives.
The best overall magic modifier is Mythical. The best modifier for magic weapons that are unable to inflict knockback (such as theNimbus RodorLast Prism) is Demonic. If the player bears low maximum mana, Masterful may be preferred over Mythical, or Mystic over Demonic. Some magic weapons, such as theClinger Staff,Magnet Sphere, andRainbow Gun, create a long-lasting projectile that remains active after switching weapons. The critical strike chance of these weapons is calculated based on the magic weapon currently being held, meaning that base damage is the only stat that matters, and therefore their best modifier is Ruthless.
The best overall summon modifier is Ruthless. The reduced mana cost, increased speed, critical strike chance, and knockback provided by Mythical are less useful: Summon weapons use mana only for the initial summoning, minions cannot deal critical hits, and their knockback is negligible even with modifiers. The Ruthless modifier offers the most effective minion boost, by increasing the minion's damage per hit the most. The best modifier for whips is Legendary.
For the purposes of mining and resource collection, the best modifier for tools such as pickaxes, hammers, and axes is Light. Note that for many tools the Legendary modifier gives the same tool speed increase as Light due to tool speed being rounded down to the next whole number. The Legendary modifier is superior in these cases as it also provides increased damage, critical strike chance, size, and knockback over the Light modifier, though the impact is relatively low given that mining tools are rarely used for combat.
If theLucky Coinor any of its upgrades is equipped, it is desirable to hit enemies as often as possible, dealing as little damage as possible, in order to maximize the income. The following modifiers reduce the weapon damage the most, yielding more coins per enemy:
Menacing, Lucky, and Warding are generally agreed to be the most consistently useful accessory modifiers.
The value of damage and critical chance vs. defense can be difficult to measure. The former directly causes fights to end sooner, while the latter causes players to die slower or potentially even reach a winning state where they regenerate more health than they lose. Because defense directly subtracts from incoming damage, each point of defense becomes more powerful in proportion to the defense a player already has. Stacking defense with multiple Warding accessories can be helpful for new players who get hit often, as well as for veterans who want to use powerful close-ranged weapons. However, if one's defense is not high enough to reduce incoming damage to 50 /75/100damage, each additional point of defense is less valuable than 1% damage or critical strike chance.
The choice between Menacing (damage) and Lucky (critical chance) has long been the subject of extensive debate among the player base. Generally speaking, balancing Menacing and Lucky (favoring Menacing) gives slightly higher DPS over a range of opponents:
Accordingly, balancing the two gives a flexible advantage with a variety of weapons and opponents.
Despite the above, all-Menacing is considered a superior choice for those who choose to depend on summoning weapons, since those gain nothing from critical-chance bonuses."
Mods,"Amod(short for ""modification"") is community-developed software that customizesTerraria'sgraphics and/or gameplay elements in some way. Mods are not developed byRe-Logic.

The following mods have their own external wikis:"
Moon_Lord,"

TheMoon Lordis aHardmode, post-Lunatic Cultistboss. He is the final boss of thePC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacyversions ofTerraria.
The Moon Lord can be spawned by destroying the fourCelestial Pillarsor by using aCelestial Sigilin any world whereGolemhas been defeated. He will then spawn one minute after thestatus message""Impending doom approaches...""appears, or 12 seconds if spawned using theCelestial Sigil. After this message appears, the screen will go dim, the music will gradually become quieter until it goes silent, and all objects and walls will oscillate back and forth. It will then go back to normal. This will happen 5 times; each time the screen will go darker and all objects and walls will oscillate more violently until the 5th time, when Moon Lord will spawn.
See below for theMoon Bitedebuffinflicted by the Moon Lord.
While Moon Lord is alive, his exclusive musicMoon Lordhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Moon_Lord.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackLunar Boss (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Lunar_Boss_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
The Moon Lord has two hands and a head that must be killed before his core becomes available for attack. He positions his two hands on either side of the player some distance away.
Each hand, as well as his head, contains a vulnerable eye-like target that is each periodically closed off and opened via an eyelid. These may only be damaged during their ""open"" states. The core, which is the only part required to be destroyed in order to defeat the boss, only becomes vulnerable when all eye sockets are destroyed.
The Moon Lord can teleport to players if all of them get too far out of range.
After defeating the Moon Lord on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, theCreditswill appear while the songJourney's Endplays. Besides his other loot, the Moon Lord always dropsLuminite, allowing the crafting of end-game materials.

Waxing Gibbous
ThemooninTerrariamoves through a cycle of eight differentphases, with the next phase in the cycle appearing eachnight. The current phase is indicated by the amount of the moon that is visible during the night. The phase of the moon affects many things, some being the shop inventory of certainNPCs, certainenemyspawn rates, and the player'sFishing Power.
It takes eight in-game nights for the moon to move through all of its phases. The cycle begins with the full moon upon world creation, where the entire circular moon is visible, and four nights later, after three waning phases, reaches the new moon, where no moon is visible. Another four nights later, after three waxing phases, the cycle ends with the return of the full moon.
Each moon phase starts at dawn[1](4:30AM) and lasts until the next dawn. Therefore, a moon phase also encompasses the day preceding the night of that moon phase. This is important because most phase-dependent content and effects are not limited to nighttime.
The current moon phase can be determined using theSextant, aninformational accessorywhich can be obtained from theAnglerNPCas afishingquest reward, or any of its upgrades.
ABlood Mooncan occur during any moon phase except for a new moon. APumpkin MoonorFrost Mooncan be summoned by the player on any night.
The following table details items and occurrences that depend on particular moon phases. It refers to both the day and the night of the stated moon phase, unless not applicable or noted otherwise.

Mount,"Mountsare creatures or objects that act as vehicles that a player can use for transportation or dealing damage. When a mount-summoning item is used, it applies an unlimitedbuffto the player, spawns the mount, and places the player on or in it. Mount movement can be controlled using the player's usual movement keys. Likepetsandminions, mounts can be used limitlessly, and their summoning items are not consumed. Only one mount can be in effect at a time. Mounts will unequip automatically when the playerdies.
Weaponsandtools(as well as any other item, excepthooks) can be used while riding a mount, except for theDrill Mount.
All mount items can be placed in the mount slot and then summoned withQuick Mount, and can bedyed. Equipping a mount provides a short burst of light (exceptBeeandScutlix).
There are currently 26 mounts, each with varying abilities and movement statistics. All mount-summoning items have the08*rarity, except for theShrimpy TruffleandWitch's Broom, which have the12*rarity, andMaster Mode-exclusive mounts, which have the13*rarity.
All mounts that do damage (e.gSlime Mount) will doSummon damage.
Mount-summoning items do not havemodifiersand therefore cannot be reforged.

Multiplayer,"Screen that appears after clicking the ""Multiplayer"" option in thePCSteam version ofTerraria.
Multiplayeris a game mode in whichTerrariacan be played with or against other remote players online. Multiplayer worlds arecooperativeby default, withplayer versus player(PvP) available for activation once multiplayer is entered.
There are two types of multiplayer environments:Serverand ""Host & Play"".
Player versus player (PvP)is a multiplayer mode that allows players, or teams of players, to attack each other. PvP is activated by joining a multiplayer world and enabling the PvP option by clicking on the crossed swordsnear the armor and accessory slots /in the PvP menu found in the inventory. In thePC versionandMobile version, the only way a player can damage another player is if both players have the PvP option enabled, or through traps such asBoulders,Land MinesorLava.
There is also the option of joining a team. Teams are represented by the colored icons near the armor and accessory slots. Once a team is selected, there is an on-screen display providing information about the distance (and direction) andhealthof the teammates. PvP players on the same team can see each other on theminimap, while other PvP players cannot.
If a player has equipped or is holding aninformational itemsuch as thePDA, any teammates standing near them can also see the data readout from it.
PvP players can playCapture the Gem, which operates similarly toCapture the Flag. Capture the Gem requiresLarge Gems, one for each team, which can be crafted using 15Amethyst,Topaz,Sapphire,Emerald,Ruby,Amber, orDiamond. Teams attempt to steal the opposing team's gem and bring it back to their own base. Large Gems display as hovering graphics over any player carrying one, and always drop next to killed players, regardless of their character'sdifficultysetting.
The Large Gems can be held in theirrespective holders, instead of having a player hold them.
These items can only be obtained in multiplayer. However, once the items are obtained, they can be transferred to a singleplayer world.
AlthoughWormhole Potionsonly drop fromPotsif the game is in multiplayer (even if the player is the only one playing at that time), they can always be crafted, even when playing on singleplayer. However, they are unusable when playing alone, so it could be considered that theirusabilityis multiplayer-exclusive and depends on having other players on the same team."
Music,"Terrariahas over eightymusictracks across every version of the game. Each one will play and loop endlessly while the player is in a specificbiomeor while certaineventsare taking place. Music is individual to each player, and as such its volume can be lowered or disabled entirely within thesettingsmenu.
The majority of music inTerrariawas composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly ofResonance Array.
In thePC version,Console version,Old-gen console version,Mobile version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is possible to record and play these songs in-game using theMusic Boxaccessory.
In thePC version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, each music track can be replaced with a custom MP3 file through the use ofresource packs.
The soundtracks can be listened to and purchasedfrom Steam as a single soundtrack. The first three volumes can be purchasedfrom Bandcamp individually. The first two volumes are also included when the game is bought onGOG.com. Tracks are listed in the order they appear on the soundtrack. All of the albums can also be listened on the streaming serviceSpotifyaswell as onApple Musicand other various music streaming services.
Volume 1 was released on November 1, 2011.
Volume 2 was released on September 28, 2013.
Volume 3 was released on October 7, 2015.
The ""Lunar Towers"" theme is a copy of the previous album's ""Lunar Boss"" theme.
Volume 4 was released on Steam on October 13, 2020.
The console soundtrack features a mix of the desktop soundtrack and several additional tracks which are listed below. AlthoughBlake Robinsonwas commissioned to create the music for the trailers, the in-game music was created byScott Lloyd Shelly.
Desktop version 1.2 adopted the console version's ""Desert"" track as is, but introduced its own ""Snow"" and ""Boss 4"" themes, using the console tracks instead respectively as ""Ice"" and ""Boss 5"". When the console version caught up with version desktop 1.2, it kept its own original ""Snow"" and ""Boss 4"" themes as they were, instead swapping the desktop's tracks to the Ice and Boss 5 slots.
The soundtrack originally written for the cancelled gameTerraria: Otherworldwas added toTerrariawith theJourney's Endupdate. It features 27 themes. In-game, theParty GirlNPC can be used to switch between normal music and ""otherworldy"" music after a world with the05162020world seed has been visited for the first time. Tracks follow the same naming convention asTerraria's, resulting in some duplicated names (music boxes for these songs disambiguate by being called ""Otherworldly Music Box"" instead of just ""Music Box""), but there are less songs in total: for example there are only two ""generic"" boss music and a single track for all invasion events. Interestingly, theWall of Fleshgets a unique theme with this soundtrack, instead of sharing the Boss 2 theme withThe Twins.Plantera, theMoon Lord, and theLunar Eventsalso get unique tracks, as in the regular soundtrack. Most pre-hardmode bosses get the Boss 1 theme; all other hardmode bosses get the Boss 2 theme.
TheTerraria: Otherworldsoundtrack was releasedon Steamon June 17, 2020. It was composed by Jeff Broadbent, Jonathan van den Wijngaarden, and James Hannigan, also featuring Jeff Ball on violin, Tina Guo on cello, and Frank Klepacki on guitar. The album version features 26 songs, one fewer than the 27 in-game tracks. The album songs also differ from the in-game songs by being much longer and holding various instrumental enhancements.
The following lists the songs as they are ordered internally for the game.
Pirate Invasion
(PC version) During morning rain, this track is played only in normal forest biome, and it would be playing from 4:30 A.M. to 7:30 A.M."
New_Chinese_version,"Thenew Chinese version (新版中国大)ofTerrariawas developed by Xinxin Network, shortly after the shutting down of theold Chinese version. It was launched on September 28, 2021 for most phones, and October 9, 2021 for iOS.
Similar to its predecessor, the new Chinese version features many changes to the game and new content, however, all of it different from that of the old version. Aside from this, it runs the same desktop equivalent as the rest of theMobile version."
NPCs#Hardmode,"NPCsare friendly automatednon-playable charactersthat provide services to players.[1]
Standing near an NPC and pressing⚷Interactwill open a dialogue window with one or more options for the player to select. Most NPCs are vendors, displaying a shop inventory when the ""Shop"" option is selected. They sellitemsto players in exchange forcoins, and can be sold items by a player to obtain coins. Some NPCs also have other options that perform other functions.
Most NPCs aretown NPCs, appearing after various milestones are achieved in game advancement. They move into structures the player must provide, known ashouses, which are generally required for town NPCs to remain available. Each NPC will need their own house,with the exception that a pet and non-pet NPC may share a house. NPCs will not move in if time freeze is on while playingJourney mode.
NPCs can reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases the more of them are present. With 3 or more town NPCs nearby, enemies generally stop spawning on or near the visible screen altogether (unless inExpert ModeorMaster Mode)[2]. Players tend to utilize this effect by building large structures (townsorbases) with several integrated houses, to serve as their safe area. These reductions are usually overridden byeventslikeBlood MoonsorGoblin Invasions, during which spawn rates return to normal or are elevated, and enemies will once again attack players and NPCs in the area.
Town NPCs generally walk around during theday. They remain still in their assigned houses at night and during events. NPCs have limitedhealthand can takedamage, and ultimatelydiefrom enemies,traps,lava, orbydrowninginwater; however, they cannot be attacked directly by players (outside of specialVoodoo Dollaccessories,Rotten Eggs, or theFlymeal). They do not suffer fromfall damageand their health regenerates over time.  The Nurse can furthermore heal herself and other nearby NPCs. Additionally:
NPCs will only move in during daytime. If an NPC is killed, they will respawn after a delay, as long as a suitable vacant house is still available.All requirements needed for the initial NPC spawn (e.g. the50requirement for theMerchant) need to be met again for the respawn.  However, a rescued NPC will remain rescued, and respawn without needing to be found again.
There are currently 26/ 23/ 21/ 19Town NPCs, 8/ 7/ 6of whom normally appear inHardmode. An additional 3/ 2/ 1NPC(s) can be encountered who do not move into houses.
Each town NPC requires a suitable, vacant house. A house is a room of a certain size enclosed by a frame ofblocks, with player-placedbackground walls, along with a validlight source, flat surface item, and comfort item. Two town NPCs cannot live in the same house at the same time. Houses must not be located nearCorruptionorCrimson, and if those biomes spread too close to an occupied house, the NPC living there may move out from that house.
Town NPC home assignments can be rearranged usingNPC flagsfrom thehousing menu, where players can also check whether a room is a suitable house.
Town NPCs will teleport home duringnight/Blood Moon,Rain,Solar Eclipse, orSlime Rainif the NPC and their home are off-screen.[3]
If a house occupied by an NPC is damaged in a way that makes them invalid, the NPC will move out and walk around the area until a suitable house is restored. If there are vacant houses available in the world, the NPC may move into one of them. If the NPC gets killed and does not have a home, they will not respawn until a new house becomes available.
TheGuideandOld Manare unique in that they always spawn upon creating a world. The Old Man is not a town NPC and will not move into a house, but rather remain near his spawn point, near theDungeon's entrance, and respawn there the following day if killed (whileSkeletronhas not yet been defeated).
Selecting the ""Shop"" option from the dialogue window, opened by pressing⚷Interactnext to a vendor NPC, will display a shop inventory similar to the player's owninventory. Items can be bought by moving them from the shop inventory into the player's inventory; the cost incoinswill be subtracted from the player's storage as soon as the item is picked up from the shop inventory. An item can only be bought if their coin cost is available in the player's inventory (or in the combined player's savings). Press and hold⚷Interacton stackable items allows the player to buy the item in bulk; the buy speed increases the longer⚷Interactis held.
Some NPCs sellbiome-specific itemswhen they are spoken to in certainbiomes. They can be transported there by housing them there and waiting for the night (they will be teleported to their house at night once off-screen) or by using aKingorQueen Statue. Note that the NPC does not need to live in the biome; talking to them while the player is in the biome is sufficient.
All NPC vendors can also be used to sell unwanted or surplus items to gain coins. The unwanted item(s) must be in the player's inventory. Hovering over the item while the NPC's inventory screen is open will display its sell value. Items are always sold to vendors at 1/5 of their purchase price. Not all items have a sell value (very common items such asDirtorWoodhave no value). Placing the item in the NPC's shop inventory will sell it, granting the player the sell value into their inventory. Sales to (and purchases from) NPCs can be cancelled while the NPC's inventory screen is still open: Sold items can be taken back in exchange for the amount they were sold for (and onPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, purchased items can be sold back in exchange for the amount they were purchased for).
All NPC vendors have the same base buying and selling price. Item prices can be decreased by equipping aDiscount Card, which is a rare drop fromPirate Invasions. OnPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, prices can also be higher or lower based on the NPC'shappiness level.
All NPC vendors will sellPylonswhen theirhappiness levelis above a certain threshold.
The NPCs are listed in the order in which they are generally likely to be acquired. SeeLiving preferencesbelow forPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderbiome and neighbor preferences. The term ""other town NPCs"" always includes theOld Man,Traveling Merchant, andTown pets, but not theSkeleton Merchant.
This content is transcluded fromTown Slimes § Types.There are 8 different town slimes and each is unlocked in a different way:
Town petsare special town NPCs that appear at dawn (4:30AM) the day after a pet license item sold by theZoologistis used. They are not to be confused withpets, which follow the player around. Town pets have distinctivehousing assignment banners, and can share houses with another NPC. They count as NPCs forpylonrequirements and for decreasing enemy spawn rates in an area, but are not counted as neighboring NPCs in other NPCs' happiness calculations, and indeed do not positively or negatively affect the happiness of other NPCs in any way. Unlike other NPCs, town pets have no means of self-defense.
Town pets offer a unique ""Pet"" option, which places the player directly in front of the pet when selected, and displays a petting animation. The effect is purely visual.
The following NPCs are not considered town NPCs because they won't live with the player or move into other houses.
The following NPCs no longer exists on any platform.
All NPCs have a base defense stat of 15 (except for theSkeleton Merchant, who has 30), and their base attack stats vary from one NPC to another. In addition, all NPCs gain specific defense and damage boosts based on thebossesthat have been defeated so far in the current world. These boosts are completely independent of each other (e.g. the ""Hardmodeentered"" boost can potentially be gained without first attaining the ""Eye of Cthulhubeaten"" boost, and vice-versa). The boosts are also permanent for a given world, and are applied instantly to all town NPCs, including allTown petsand allother NPCs.[4]
TheDryadalso gains boosts to her attack damage. She does not deal damage directly, but rather by inflicting theDryad's Banedebuff on enemies. These boosts to the Dryad's Bane debuff are not quite the same as those damage-stat boosts, however, so both kinds of boosts are listed in the following table. Just as with the stat boosts, the Dryad's Bane boosts are independent of each other, are permanent for a given world, and are applied instantly to all enemies inflicted with the debuff.[5]
Defeating theDeerclopswill not give stat boosts to NPCs.
Multiple different factors affect the happiness of an NPC, including neighboring NPCs and current biome they live in.
An alternative way to display NPCs' opinions of each other and the biomes they live in
An NPC's happiness determines their buying and selling prices, giving the player up to a 25-33% benefit when happiest, or similar detriment when unhappiest.  Happiness is based on thebiomethe NPC lives in and which other NPCs are nearby.  All NPCs have happiness, but aside from the flavor text when choosing the Happiness dialog option, the only in-game effect is on prices.  Only the NPCs the player buys and sells from need to be happy and only while the player is buying and selling.  NPCs who don't sell goods or services (like the Guide or Angler) can be placed where most convenient, or used to make other NPCs happy.  NPCs can be moved, but can take up to an in-game day or so to move from one living space to another.
The most accurate way to judge most NPC's happiness is to check their prices.  The happiest NPC who can offer a pylon will sell it for 7 gold 50 silver.  There is a ""Happiness"" option in every NPCs dialogue window, that makes the NPC tell the player if any factors make them currently happy or unhappy, although they often try to put a positive spin on things and will not say what could make them happier or unhappier. For example, if theGuideis located alone in aForest, he will praise the lack of other NPCs around and the fact he is in a Forest, but not that he would prefer to live near theClothierorZoologist.
NPC happiness will lower their prices for goods purchased from them, down to a minimum of75*3/4 (75%), and increase the value of goods sold to them by the inverse of the same modifier, up to a maximum of133*4/3 (133%). Conversely, NPC unhappiness will raise prices for goods purchased from them, up to a maximum of150*3/2 (150%), and decrease the value of goods sold to them, down to a minimum67*2/3 (67%)(rounded to the nearest 1%). When an NPC that sells items, other than the Skeleton Merchant or Traveling Merchant, has a price modifier at or below 90%, they will allow the player to purchase thepylonfor their current biome. TheTax Collector's current tax funds and tax collection limit are both divided by his happiness factor, such that at maximum happiness he will store up to133333, and at maximum unhappiness he will only store up to66666; the amount of taxes that he collects per minute also scales at the same rate.[7][8]
For the purpose of calculating distances below, the position of an NPC'shome tileis considered instead of the NPC itself, unless the NPC is homeless in which case their actual position is considered. The home tile is the block where NPCs stand on during nights and events.NPC's flagwill ""hook"" directly above the home tile. One can easily find the home tile by locating the central column of the 3×3-tile area that the NPC's flag occupies, and then moving all the way down to the tile in the floor of the house. For more detailed definition of a home tile, seeHouse § Home tile score.
Similarly, biome-related preferences will reference the primary biome where theplayeris, rather than where the NPC or their home is. If the player is in ahybrid biome, and the NPC likes/loves one of the biome, that biome will take priority in the happiness calculation. However, if they are being neutral to, dislike, or hate all the biomes nearby, or they are in theDungeon,Corruption, orCrimson, the happiness calculation will be based on the following biome priority.
An NPC's happiness is computed the moment their chat window is opened,[10]which means that their happiness can be altered very quickly (e.g. by closing their chat window, adding or removing nearby NPC flags, and re-opening the chat window).
The below price modifiers are applied in the order shown in the table. If the modifier is prefixed with a star, it is multiplied with the running total of the modifier, and if prefixed with an equals sign, the modifier is instead set to that value, overriding all prior logic. The final multiplier is capped at a minimum of 67% and a maximum of 150%. TheTraveling MerchantandSkeleton Merchantare special cases; they skip over the happiness-pricing logic in the table below and instead simply always set their multipliers to 100%.
(Note: ThePrincessis liked by all NPCs, and therefore is not put in every column for the sake of less clutter.)

NPCs#Pre-Hardmode,"NPCsare friendly automatednon-playable charactersthat provide services to players.[1]
Standing near an NPC and pressing⚷Interactwill open a dialogue window with one or more options for the player to select. Most NPCs are vendors, displaying a shop inventory when the ""Shop"" option is selected. They sellitemsto players in exchange forcoins, and can be sold items by a player to obtain coins. Some NPCs also have other options that perform other functions.
Most NPCs aretown NPCs, appearing after various milestones are achieved in game advancement. They move into structures the player must provide, known ashouses, which are generally required for town NPCs to remain available. Each NPC will need their own house,with the exception that a pet and non-pet NPC may share a house. NPCs will not move in if time freeze is on while playingJourney mode.
NPCs can reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases the more of them are present. With 3 or more town NPCs nearby, enemies generally stop spawning on or near the visible screen altogether (unless inExpert ModeorMaster Mode)[2]. Players tend to utilize this effect by building large structures (townsorbases) with several integrated houses, to serve as their safe area. These reductions are usually overridden byeventslikeBlood MoonsorGoblin Invasions, during which spawn rates return to normal or are elevated, and enemies will once again attack players and NPCs in the area.
Town NPCs generally walk around during theday. They remain still in their assigned houses at night and during events. NPCs have limitedhealthand can takedamage, and ultimatelydiefrom enemies,traps,lava, orbydrowninginwater; however, they cannot be attacked directly by players (outside of specialVoodoo Dollaccessories,Rotten Eggs, or theFlymeal). They do not suffer fromfall damageand their health regenerates over time.  The Nurse can furthermore heal herself and other nearby NPCs. Additionally:
NPCs will only move in during daytime. If an NPC is killed, they will respawn after a delay, as long as a suitable vacant house is still available.All requirements needed for the initial NPC spawn (e.g. the50requirement for theMerchant) need to be met again for the respawn.  However, a rescued NPC will remain rescued, and respawn without needing to be found again.
There are currently 26/ 23/ 21/ 19Town NPCs, 8/ 7/ 6of whom normally appear inHardmode. An additional 3/ 2/ 1NPC(s) can be encountered who do not move into houses.
Each town NPC requires a suitable, vacant house. A house is a room of a certain size enclosed by a frame ofblocks, with player-placedbackground walls, along with a validlight source, flat surface item, and comfort item. Two town NPCs cannot live in the same house at the same time. Houses must not be located nearCorruptionorCrimson, and if those biomes spread too close to an occupied house, the NPC living there may move out from that house.
Town NPC home assignments can be rearranged usingNPC flagsfrom thehousing menu, where players can also check whether a room is a suitable house.
Town NPCs will teleport home duringnight/Blood Moon,Rain,Solar Eclipse, orSlime Rainif the NPC and their home are off-screen.[3]
If a house occupied by an NPC is damaged in a way that makes them invalid, the NPC will move out and walk around the area until a suitable house is restored. If there are vacant houses available in the world, the NPC may move into one of them. If the NPC gets killed and does not have a home, they will not respawn until a new house becomes available.
TheGuideandOld Manare unique in that they always spawn upon creating a world. The Old Man is not a town NPC and will not move into a house, but rather remain near his spawn point, near theDungeon's entrance, and respawn there the following day if killed (whileSkeletronhas not yet been defeated).
Selecting the ""Shop"" option from the dialogue window, opened by pressing⚷Interactnext to a vendor NPC, will display a shop inventory similar to the player's owninventory. Items can be bought by moving them from the shop inventory into the player's inventory; the cost incoinswill be subtracted from the player's storage as soon as the item is picked up from the shop inventory. An item can only be bought if their coin cost is available in the player's inventory (or in the combined player's savings). Press and hold⚷Interacton stackable items allows the player to buy the item in bulk; the buy speed increases the longer⚷Interactis held.
Some NPCs sellbiome-specific itemswhen they are spoken to in certainbiomes. They can be transported there by housing them there and waiting for the night (they will be teleported to their house at night once off-screen) or by using aKingorQueen Statue. Note that the NPC does not need to live in the biome; talking to them while the player is in the biome is sufficient.
All NPC vendors can also be used to sell unwanted or surplus items to gain coins. The unwanted item(s) must be in the player's inventory. Hovering over the item while the NPC's inventory screen is open will display its sell value. Items are always sold to vendors at 1/5 of their purchase price. Not all items have a sell value (very common items such asDirtorWoodhave no value). Placing the item in the NPC's shop inventory will sell it, granting the player the sell value into their inventory. Sales to (and purchases from) NPCs can be cancelled while the NPC's inventory screen is still open: Sold items can be taken back in exchange for the amount they were sold for (and onPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, purchased items can be sold back in exchange for the amount they were purchased for).
All NPC vendors have the same base buying and selling price. Item prices can be decreased by equipping aDiscount Card, which is a rare drop fromPirate Invasions. OnPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, prices can also be higher or lower based on the NPC'shappiness level.
All NPC vendors will sellPylonswhen theirhappiness levelis above a certain threshold.
The NPCs are listed in the order in which they are generally likely to be acquired. SeeLiving preferencesbelow forPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoaderbiome and neighbor preferences. The term ""other town NPCs"" always includes theOld Man,Traveling Merchant, andTown pets, but not theSkeleton Merchant.
This content is transcluded fromTown Slimes § Types.There are 8 different town slimes and each is unlocked in a different way:
Town petsare special town NPCs that appear at dawn (4:30AM) the day after a pet license item sold by theZoologistis used. They are not to be confused withpets, which follow the player around. Town pets have distinctivehousing assignment banners, and can share houses with another NPC. They count as NPCs forpylonrequirements and for decreasing enemy spawn rates in an area, but are not counted as neighboring NPCs in other NPCs' happiness calculations, and indeed do not positively or negatively affect the happiness of other NPCs in any way. Unlike other NPCs, town pets have no means of self-defense.
Town pets offer a unique ""Pet"" option, which places the player directly in front of the pet when selected, and displays a petting animation. The effect is purely visual.

Some items are dropped by all enemies (except enemies spawned bystatues,Old One's Armyenemies,Lunar Eventsenemies, andMeteor Heads) under certain conditions. Those can be found below.
Most enemies will typically drop a few stacks ofcoinsafter dying. Enemies that drop a large number of coins have a higher chance of dropping multiple stacks.
The total amount of money dropped is calculated using a ""base value"", which depends on the enemy, and inExpert Mode, the ""base value"" is multiplied by 2.5 and weak enemies receive an additional multiplier to it inHardmodeand afterPlanterahas been defeated depending on their normal mode stats. ASkeleton, for example, has a ""base value"" on normal mode of1, and on Expert Mode,250in pre-Hardmode,2in Hardmode, and4after Plantera has been defeated. The exact amount of money dropped is this number multiplied by 80–120%.
After the amount of money is determined, there are then a few chances for the number to be increased.
These increases are not mutually exclusive, are multiplicative, and an enemy may have its money increased several times. It is possible to get all increases at once, as each one is rolled individually. Additionally, theMidasdebuffincreases the money dropped by 10–49%. The average amount dropped, therefore, is 106.14% of the ""base"" value, or 137.45% if the enemy is afflicted with Midas. It is possible to get it increased even more by theLucky Coin.
Old-gen console versions of the game give players a chance to have double the loot drop from any enemy. The exact chance of this happening is0.1*1/1000 (0.1%)Verify. Players can easily see the effect when farming for more common loot such as souls or gel. It can be extremely useful if farming for rare items, like theRod of DiscordorSniper Rifle, as two can be obtained from one kill. However, this obviously requires a lot of luck, as the chance of this occurring is at about 0.5%Verify.
Drops on the ground (i.e. not in the player'sinventoryor in astorage item) will despawn (disappear) upon exiting the world. At that point, it is impossible to reacquire them. If there are more than 400 ""loose"", dropped items in the world, items will also start despawning. In this instance, the items that have remained on the ground for the longest amount of time may vanish as new items are added to the screen.
Most item drops are thematically keyed to the enemy that drops them.  Some enemies will drop (a version of) their own weapon or magical attack; some drop an accessory which protects against the samedebuff(s)they inflict.  This last case particularly includes the many components of theAnkh Charm.  Bosses and minibosses (notably Biome Mimics) often have a guaranteed drop, or guarantee one item from a list."
Nurse,"TheNurseis anNPCthat will spawn once the following criteria have been met:
The Nurse will heal the player's health and cure them of any activedebuffsat the cost ofCoins(there are exceptions, seeNotesandHistory).
In theWindows Phone,Old Chinese,3DS, andtModLoader Legacyversions, healing costs can range from a fewCopperto severalSilver Coins, depending on how much health the player is missing. She charges Copper equal to 75% of the health restored (e.g.75for restoring 100 health), plus an additional750for every active debuff on the player.
In thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, healing costs are1per health restored, plus an additional1per active debuff on the player, all multiplied by the Nurse's currentHappiness price adjustment, and then doubled if playing onExpert Mode. Also, the Nurse charges increasing amounts of money for healing as the game progresses; these specific increases are detailed below. Thus, at the start of the game, the cost of restoring 100 health can range from75/150(with maximum happiness) to150/3(with maximum unhappiness), while by endgame it can range from150/3up to3/6.
In thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, she will fight enemies by throwingsyringes that will deal 8 /12/14damage (affected by variousstat boosts), andpoisonenemies for 3–5 seconds.[1]She can also usehealing syringes to heal herself and other nearby NPCs for 20 health.[2]
The cost of healing changes based on three factors: The Nurse's currentHappiness, game progression, andExpert Mode. Happiness affects the Nurse's price by raising or lowering it to within a range of 75% to 150% of its base (in the same way that other NPCs' prices are affected by their happiness). Playing in Expert (orMaster) mode further affects prices by permanently doubling them. Progression-based price increases are based on which bosses have been defeated in the current world. These increases are listed in the table below; only the singlehighest applicable increaseis chosen and applied.
For more information, seeNPC happiness.
When submerged inShimmer, the Nurse will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again.

Old-gen_console_version,"The old-gen console releases have a unique loading icon, a slightly illuminatedThorn Ball projectile.
TheOld-gen console versionofTerrariawas published by505 Gamesand developed byEngine Software. It is a port of thePC version, which is developed byRe-Logic. This version contains exclusive content not available on other versions, includingenemies,achievements,musictracks andMusic Boxes,armor,weapons,pets, and aboss, but most exclusive content is also available on theWindows Phone versionandNintendo3DSversion.

Terrariawas released in thePlayStation Networkin Japan during May 2013. It was translated by Japanese video game development and localization companySpike Chunsoft.
The Japanese old-gen console versions (PS3, PS Vita, Wii U) seem to have everything the U.S. console versions have, aside fromPurple Thread(instead, they useWhite Thread) and due to copyright issues, theHero's setwas replaced with theMonokuma set, and thePlumber's setwas replaced with theShiren set. They also have other exclusive costumes, crafted from the exclusive White Thread, shown below.
The Japaneseuses Purple Thread (むらさきのいと) instead of White Thread, and has the green Hero's set (ゆうしゃの衣装) and Plumber's set (はいかんこうの衣装).
Japanese PS4 now usesGreen Thread(instead of White Thread), and the Hero's set and Plumber's set were added. The Monokuma and Shiren sets are still obtainable, however the other sets appear to have been removed.[5]

Old_Man,"Have you seen that old man pacing around the dungeon? He looks troubled.
—The Nurse
TheOld Manis anNPCwhose primary function is to summonSkeletron. He can be found at theDungeon's entrance. When spoken to atnight, the Old Man will give the player the option to ""Curse"", which summons Skeletron. When spoken to during the day, the Old Man will tell the player to return at night. He will also judge players with 300 maximumhealth(15 hearts) or less, or 10defenseor less as unworthy but still allows them to summon Skeletron.
The Dungeon can be entered without defeating Skeletron, but traveling deeper than ground level within it (below zerodepth) will spawnDungeon Guardiansthat will most likely kill the player on contact (seeGuide:Dungeon Guardian strategies).
When Skeletron is defeated, the Old Man is freed from his curse and will arrive as theClothier(as long as a vacanthouseis available), in addition to allowing access to the Dungeon.
During the day:
When the player has 300 or less max health or 10 or less defense:

Old_One%27s_Army,"TheOld One's Armyis a uniqueDungeon Defenders 2crossovereventthat can be triggered by placing anEternia Crystalon theEternia Crystal Stand. Waves of enemies begin spawning fromportalson both sides of thecrystal, seeking to destroy it. The objective is to protect it until all waves are cleared – if the crystal is destroyed, the event ends.
There are three different versions of the event: It first becomes available after defeating theEater of Worlds/Brain of Cthulhu(first tier), it then receives a substantial increase in difficulty after defeating anymechanical boss(second tier), and upgrades to its final version onceGolemhas been defeated (third tier).
Clearing later waves after wave one rewards the player withDefender Medals, a unique currency that can be used to purchase specialweaponsandarmorfrom theTavernkeepNPC. This gear is specifically suited for the event, due to its exceptional level of difficulty. Not only are its enemies extraordinarily resistant, it also employs numerousanti-cheat/exploit mechanisms, such as preventing the player from placing or removingblocksorliquidsfor its duration.
To initiate the Old One's Army event, anEternia Crystal Standmust be placed first. AnEternia Crystalmust then be placed on it by pressing the⚷Interactkey on the stand. Both the crystal and its stand are purchased from theTavernkeepNPCforcoins. The Tavernkeep can be found randomly in a world after theEater of Worldsor theBrain of Cthulhuhas been defeated.
Summoning this event has some unique requirements for the terrain around the summon area. If they are not fulfilled, the Eternia Crystal cannot be placed successfully, and astatus messageappears informing the player that the surface is inadequate.
The player can build up to a height of three tiles before blocks are considered obstructing the necessary space.Platformsandinactiveblocks do not count as part of a flat floor, and will count against the three-tile height allowance; but floor blocks with Actuators on them that are solid when the crystal is placed will count as flat, and can be successfully actuated after the event has started. In addition, closed trap doors are considered flat, and can be successfully opened and/or reclosed during the event.
The event consists of a set number of waves, with each wave becoming progressively more difficult (seewave chart). At the end of each wave, there is a 30-second countdown to the next wave, signified by a timer appearing over the Eternia Crystal.
The event comes in three possible tiers, depending on game progression when the event is triggered:
In addition to the difference in bosses, the common event enemies also differ between Tiers, with stronger statistics and a more menacing appearance in higher tiers.
The completion of each wave, beginning with the third, awards the playerDefender Medals, a special currency used to purchase items from theTavernkeepNPCthat can help players defeat future Old One's Armies. Among them are specialsentry summon weapons, which are fueled byEtherian Mana, a resource that drops only during this event. Etherian Mana allows multiple sentry minions to remain placed simultaneously and permanently until the event is over, with more Etherian Mana allowing more sentries to be placed. All Etherian Mana disappears once the event is over, whether uncollected or within the player's inventory.
At the beginning of the event, the player will receive 10 Etherian Mana, allowing them to place one sentry. Note that sentries not obtained from the Tavernkeep (such as theQueen Spider Staff) do not and cannot use Etherian Mana, but can be summoned separately.
Each sentry type available from the Tavernkeep (Flameburst,Explosive Trap,Lightning Aura,Ballista) comes in three different tiers: Rod, Cane, and Staff, with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful.
Once the event is completed successfully in a world, the weapons can then be used outside the event with normal summoning rules.
Each boss and mini-boss in the event has atrophy(10% chance) and amask(14.29% chance).Betsyalso drops aTreasure BaginExpert Mode(100% chance).
Several enemies also droppets,vanityitems, and powerfulweaponsandaccessories. Allenemy bannersdropped during this event are non-functional, and do not provide the player with any of the usual defense or damage boosts that other enemy banners provide.
Enemies will not drop biome-specific drops, such asBiome Keys, orcoins, even when wearing theLucky Coinor its derivatives. They also do not dropPresentsduringChristmas, norGoodie BagsduringHalloween.
Things that are still possible:
The Old One's Army event brings associated equipment. The armor and sentry weapons are available from theTavernkeepin exchange forDefender Medals, while other weapons and accessories are dropped by event enemies. Though all of the equipment is coordinated with other equipment of the same class, the only specific benefit from this coordination is the buffs granted to each sentry by the corresponding armor set bonus; neither the weapons nor the accessories are involved in any additional unique bonuses, and so can be used with any other armor or exchanged for any other weapon at the player's preference.
Tier 2 items become available after oneMechanical Bossis defeated, and Tier 3 items become available afterGolemis defeated.

Ore,"Oresare primarycrafting materialsnecessary for game progress. They generally must be crafted intobarsat aFurnace, after which they can craft several essentialtools,weapons,armor, and otheritems. Some items require raw ores themselves, most commonlybricksandpotions. Raw ores can also be used as plain blocks for construction.
Ores are generally found as veins of placedblocksin theUndergroundlayerand below, and are mined with apickaxeordrill. Lower-tier ores can be found amongDirtnear thesurface, or withinFloating Islands. Some ores are also dropped bybosses, namelyEye of Cthulhu,Eater of Worlds,Brain of Cthulhu,Ocram, andMoon Lord.
AnExtractinatorandWooden Crates(fromfishing) also provide ores as random rewards.
A world will generally only contain one ore type from each tier, which is chosen at random, for instance; one world may haveCopperandIron Ores, while another may have Copper andLead Ores(seetables below). The alternate ore types which do not generate naturally in a world, can still be obtained by other means, such ascrates,bonus drops, or loot from an Extractinator.Hardmodeore types are chosen at random as soon as the player destroys anAltar.
There are21 /20 different types of ores.

The first three tiers ofHardmodeores are spawned by destroyingDemon/Crimson Altars, which requires ahammerwith 80% hammer power or higher, e.g. thePwnhammer.Chlorophyte Orespawns on its own once Hardmode is triggered, though it cannot be mined before defeating all of themechanical bosses, andLuminitedoes not occur naturally. Neither ores are affected by destroyed altars.This content is transcluded fromAltars.
Players will be able to find these new ores scattered across the Undergroundlayerto near-Underworldlevels, with them replacing most blocks created during world generation. They will spawn at random locations in varying quantity, in places explored and unexplored alike.
The number of ore veins generated upon destroying an altar is determined by the following formula:[1]

The table below visualizes this and shows how many ore veins will be spawned for each altar destroyed. If 264 altars were to be destroyed in one world, all following altars would only spawn one ore vein.

All Hardmode ores will avoid spawning in the outer 100 tiles of the world. The highest location for Cobalt and Palladium to spawn is just below thesurface, Mythril and Orichalcum start to spawn from the top of theCavernlayer, and Adamantite and Titanium start to spawn in the Cavern layer, lower than Mythril/Orichalcum.[2]All ores stop spawning at 150 tiles above the world's bottom border, i.e. about one fourth intothe Underworld.
The amount of altars smashed does not affect the size of ore veins, only the amount. As the generation of each vein is heavily randomized, it is difficult to give exact high and low values from ""optimal"" veins. Instead, a table of ""good luck"" vein amounts and ""bad luck"" vein amounts is shown below. Average yield is likely between 30–40% due to occasional lost ore.

Note however, that the above table assumes that all the ore actually replaces blocks. Ore will only spawn if it attempts to replace one of the blocks listed in the table below.
In addition to this, Hardmode ores will not generate overGranite Blocks,Marble Blocks, or any hardened sands, and as such cannot be found in theGranite Cave,Marble Cave, andUnderground Desertbiomes without replaceable blocks already existing there.
Ore alternatives are not mutually exclusive indrunk worlds, as displayed here (Copper Ore on the left, Tin Ore on the right).

Basic Paint is purchased from thePainterNPC. Two of the same color can be combined at aDye Vatto create ""Deep"" color versions, which apply their color more vividly and are required in order to paint certain objects.
Paint is applied to blocks and furniture with thePaintbrush, and to walls with thePaint Roller, with each tile consuming one bucket of Paint. ThePaint Sprayerwill automatically paint items when placing them. Paint can be removed with thePaint Scraper, although it will never be retrieved upon doing so. Destroying a painted block will not drop the Paint item either.
Paint can occupy the player's ammo inventory space. If more than one color is present in the player's inventory, the color in the earliest inventory slot is used first (starting from the ammo inventory space, then proceeding from the top-left slot).
Coatingsare a special type of paint-like item. They function identically to normal paint in all ways except that coatings and paint can be applied to a block to combine their color and effect. Additionally, coatings can co-exist with each other.

APartyis aneventthat can occur randomly, or be activated manually using aParty Center. Parties are mainly visual, having little functional effect on gameplay, with the exception of some exclusive vanity and novelty items available from theClothierandParty Girl. A Party lasts until 7:30PM, and if spawned randomly, begins at 4:30AM.
A Party has a random10*1/10 (10%)chance of occurring at any particulardawn(""thrown"" by one to threeNPCs), without the need for a placed Party Center. Seebelowfor the detailed conditions. When NPCs throw a Party, any placed Party Center activates, a burst of confetti appears on each NPC, and a pinkstatus messagedisplays:""Looks like <NPC name>, <NPC name>, and <NPC name> are throwing a party"". At its conclusion, the Party automatically deactivates with a puff of smoke on all NPCs and another pink status message:""Party time's over!"". A Party can still be re-initiated manually afterward.

Sometimes she may drop a large quantity of Happy Grenades upon her death.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, when talked to during a naturalParty, she will give the first player to talk to her aSlice of Cake.

After the world with seed05162020is visited, the game unlocks the option to toggle the game's defaultsoundtrackfor theTerraria: Otherworldsoundtrack, by selecting the ""Music"" option through the Party Girl. Once unlocked, the option carries across all players and all worlds.
Every song inTerraria's soundtrack is replaced, and those that do not have aTerraria: Otherworldequivalent will use the most relevant song; for example, theUnderground Junglewill simply useTerraria: Otherworld'sJungletheme, rather thanTerraria's Underground Jungle theme.
On a multiplayer world, players only hear the altered soundtrack if they have used the ""Music"" option themselves, which is only present for those who have visited seed05162020. However, Otherworld music boxes are listenable for all players on multiplayer worlds, regardless of whether they've toggled the option before.
Every new song has its own uniqueMusic Box, all of which are called ""Otherworldly Music Boxes"".
Upon leaving the world, the soundtrack will revert to the default.

Pets are manually summoned by placing their item on the hotbar and using them orby equipping them. OnPC,Console,Old-gen console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacy, pets can be dismissed by pressing the⚷Interactbutton on their corresponding buff icon orby turning off the visibility.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, theinventoryoffers two dedicated slots, offering more complex behavior: One slot is for ""regular"" pets, the other is for light pets. Light pets behave similarly to ordinary pets, but provide more consistent lighting around the player. At any time, the player can have at most one pet of each type active.
















































These pets can only be acquired inMaster Mode, but can be used anywhere.





















Light Petsare summoned secondary characters that float alongside players to provide a traveling light source. They incur nomananor any other cost, and remain indefinitely until the player cancels the buff, summons a replacement light pet or dies. Only one light pet can be present at once. Light pets have their own dedicated inventory slot in the player's equipment section in thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionalong with a slot fordyes.







These light pets can only be acquired inMaster Mode, but can be used anywhere.

TheBestiaryentry for the Pirate:""Ahoy! The only good Pirate Captain is... one that sells cannons and weapons to take out all competing Pirate Captains!"""
Pirate_Invasion,"ThePirate Invasionis aHardmodeeventwhere pirate-themedenemiesspawn and swarm the world's originalspawn point. A Pirate Invasion can occur randomly after certain conditions are met, or alternatively when the player uses aPirate Map.
For a single-player invasion, the player must kill 120 pirates before the event is completed. This number increases with each additional player.
Once the first Pirate Invasion in a world has been defeated and a suitablehouseis vacant, thePirateNPCwill move in.
Once the player has defeated at least one pirate invasion in a post-Planteraworld, they can purchase aLand Mine. However, on old Gen they can be purchased without defeatingPlantera.
A group of Pirates.
The Pirate Invasion can be summoned manually using aPirate Map, which drops from all enemies in theOceanbiome.
If the following conditions are fulfilled, a Pirate Invasion can also occur randomly:
The chances of a random Pirate Invasion are as follows:
When a Pirate Invasion occurs, it will be announced by astatus message; either""Pirates are approaching from the west!""or""Pirates are approaching from the east!""The message will repeat several times until the pirates reach the initialspawnof the world or any area of the world above the surface which has a nearbyNPC. When the pirates' initial wave reaches the spawn, their arrival is announced with""The pirates have arrived!""
If the first status message says ""west"", then the initial pirates will come from the left. Otherwise, if the message says ""east"", they will arrive from the right. Note that these directions are not related to the apparentmotion of the sun and the moon, which, inTerraria, appear to move from left (""west"") to right (""east"")."
Plantera,"Planterais aHardmodebossthat can be fought in theUnderground Jungleafter all threemechanical bosses(The Destroyer,Skeletron Prime, andThe Twins) have been defeated. Plantera drops aTemple Keyupon defeat, allowing access to theJungle Temple. She appears as a living dragonflower bulb with vines that she can grab onto, once half health her appearance changes to a carnivorous state with thorn-like fangs and a split-tongue, she will also have tentacles known as ""chompers"" sprouting out from her body.
While Plantera is alive, her exclusive musicPlanterahttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Plantera.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackPlantera (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Plantera_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
After all three mechanical bosses have been defeated,Plantera's Bulbswill randomly spawn in the Underground Jungle (indicated by thestatus message""The jungle grows restless...""). Instead of spawning instantly after defeating the mechanical bosses, they grow similar toChlorophyte Ore. Destroying one of these bulbs will immediately cause Plantera to spawn, usually a fair distance off-screen. The bulbs can be broken in various ways including: with apickaxeordrill, withDynamite, withlava, or if theJungle grassunderneath them is removed, e.g. viabiome spread,actuatingthe blocks, or theClentaminator.
First form
Second form.
Plantera moves through blocks slowly, using long vines to grapple foreground blocks, similar to multi-hooks. In the second phase Plantera also grabsbackground walls. The ends of her vines,Plantera's Hooks, are invincible and deal contact damage.
Plantera creeps after the player, deals damage on contact, and fires the projectiles listed in the following table at them. She generally keeps her distance from the player, focusing on her ranged attacks.
Seeds and Poison Seeds are similar to the stingers ofHornetsandQueen Bee, and the petals of theFlower Pow. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the green Poison Seeds have a 50% /100%chance to inflict thePoisoneddebuff. Thorn Balls are similar to the projectiles released bySpiky Ball Traps, bouncing around erratically. They can overwhelm the player if they stay in the same area for too long.
Poison Seeds and Thorn Balls are only dispensed while Plantera is below 80% health (24,000 /33,600/42,839).
There is a short cooldown after a projectile has been fired, which depends on Plantera's health as well as the type of the projectile:
Once Plantera is brought down to half of her maximum health (15,000 /21,000/26,775), she changes to her second form; her pink petals fall away to reveal a thorn-filled mouth. In this form, Plantera ceases to fire the projectiles from before and instead moves more aggressively in attempts to make contact. Her contact damage is greater than in the first form, but her defense significantly decreases, down to 10.
Upon transformation, Plantera sprouts eight additional mouths,Plantera's Tentacles, that are attached via vines to her body. These deal contact damage and get in the way of the player's attacks, but have comparatively little health. Defeated tentacles will not regrow, making Plantera much easier to fight once all are killed.
Plantera now occasionally releases floating pink spore projectiles that drift towards the player, similar to the spores released by theGiant Fungi Bulb. They can be destroyed in a single hit with anyweaponortool, but travel through blocks and deal high damage. Similarly to the first phase, the cooldown between releases depends on Plantera's health.
Plantera becomes ""enraged"" if she follows the player out of theUnderground Junglebiome, whether it be to the surface, to theUnderworld, to aCorrupted/CrimsonedorHallowedpart of the Underground Jungle, or to a completely different biome. This causes her to obtain double damage, double defense (quadruple defense in the second form) and increased movement speed, as well as changing her attack patterns and directly rushing the player. Her projectiles also deal double damage and have reduced cooldowns. Plantera's behavior returns to normal upon re-entry of the Underground Jungle.
InExpert Mode, there are a few significant differences in Plantera's attacks, aside from the default increased health and damage.
In the first form, her pink Seeds can travel through blocks, and all projectiles have limited homing capabilities. The cooldowns are also decreased:
In her second form, Plantera and Plantera's Tentacles move faster than normal. In addition, there are nine more Plantera's Tentacles, attached to Plantera's Hooks in groups of three. Furthermore, the eight tentacles that are attached to Plantera's body can respawn after they have been killed (this does not apply to the tentacles on the hooks). The rate is randomized, but it depends on the number of tentacles that are alive – if all are dead, a new tentacle will be spawned after 5 seconds, on average. This is increased by 5 seconds per living tentacle, hence it takes an average of 180 seconds for all eight tentacles to fully respawn. A single defeated tentacle will take 40 seconds to respawn, on average, assuming the other seven tentacles remain alive for the duration.[1]
Plantera always drops aTemple Key, which grants access to theJungle Templeand theGolemboss. In theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version, andNintendo3DSversion, Temple Keys can also be combined withBiome Key Moldsto craftBiome Keys; but in thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, Biome Keys drop in their respective biomes and do not require molds.
Astatus messagesaying""Screams are echoing from the dungeon...""will appear upon Plantera's defeat, signaling that new, more difficultenemytypes will begin spawning in theDungeon(see details). These drop powerful new weapons, accessories, and other items.Dungeon Spiritswill begin to appear when Dungeon enemies with more than 100 health are slain, which dropEctoplasm, a newcrafting materialthat offers access to thePumpkin MoonandFrost Moonevents, as well asSpectre Bars.

Plants,"Plantsare found all across aTerrariaworld, and may grow from certainblocktypes given various conditions. Most can be harvested for use, and may additionally dropseedsfor replanting, such as Grass and Herbs. Differentbiomesgenerally have distinct plant life.
Grassenables many plants to grow on it, and covers most of the aboveground landscape. There are seven types of grass: Normal, Corrupt, Crimson, Mushroom, Jungle, Hallowed and Ash grass.

Mossis a grass-like plant that grows onStone Blocks. It comes in several different colors and can be found either randomly on Cave surfaces or inmoss chamberswith a matching mossy wall. Moss sprouts fuzz that can be cut like grass weeds. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, it can be collected as an item using aPaint Scraperand used for replanting or crafting mossy walls.
This content is transcluded fromMoss § Types.
Herbsare used at aPlaced Bottleor anAlchemy Tableto craftpotions. They can be found all across the world, or inHerb Bags, and can be harvested with almost anyweaponortool. Each herb will bloom when certain requirements are met. Herbs harvested while blooming will drop 1-3seedsof their kind in addition.
This content is transcluded fromHerbs § Types.There are currently 7 different types of herbs. In addition to their natural soil, herbs can also be grown inClay Pots, or withinPlanter Boxes. The Daybloom can also be dropped fromAngry Dandelions.
Mushroomsareplantswhich grow randomly on manygrassesand other blocks inTerraria. There are currently 6 types of mushrooms:
Regular Mushrooms can be turned into Vile Mushrooms and vice versa using Purification Powder, Unholy Water, or Holy Water, respectively.
Vinesare plants that grow downward from blocks. Given there is enough empty space, they can reach a length of up to ten tiles. Although they block light(excluding Glowing Mushroom vines, which produce light), they do not impede movement and can easily be destroyed with nearly anyweaponortool. Destroying a tile of a vine destroys all tiles of the vine below it and destroying the topmost tile or mining the block it hangs from will destroy the entire vine.
There are six different types of vines: Regular vines (growing fromGrassandLeaf Blocks), Flower vines (growing fromGrassin grassy caves, or in front of player-placedGrassorFlowerwalls), Jungle vines (growing fromJungle grassblocks), Glowing Mushroom vines (growing fromMushroom grass), Hallowed vines (growing fromHallowed grassblocks), and Crimson vines (growing fromCrimson grassblocks). There is no Corruption variant of vines. Vines can only grow above thesurface(with the exception of Jungle and Glowing Mushroom vines which can grow at any elevation) and only from blocks that are notslopedon their underside.
Vines can bepainted. New vines growing from painted blocks will take on the color of that block and vine tiles spawned by naturally extending vines will take on the color of the existing tip of the vine. InHardmode, Crimson and Hallowed vines qualify as spreading tiles in regard tobiome spread. TheGuide to Plant Fiber Cordageallows the collection ofVine Ropesfrom vines.
Vines will never drop theVineobject; this is an uncommonMan Eaterdrop. In spite of this, Glowing Mushroom vines will dropGlowing Mushroomswhen destroyed.
Forest cattails in a lake.
Cattailsare plants that grow naturally on blocks submerged underwater 1-7 blocks deep. They are background objects and can be destroyed with mostweaponsortools, but only Glowing Mushroom cattails yield drops. They can grow up to 1 tile above the surface of the water. Destroying a tile of the cattail will destroy all tiles of the cattail above it and destroying the base or block it's attached to will completely destroy the cattail.
There are 6 types of cattails: Regular cattails (growing fromGrass), Jungle cattails (growing fromJungle grassandSand Blocksin anOasis), Hallowed cattails (growing fromHallowed grass), Glowing Mushroom cattails (growing fromMushroom grass), Corruption cattails (growing fromCorrupt grass) and Crimson cattails (growing fromCrimson grass). Excluding Glowing Mushroom cattails, cattails can only grow above surface level.
Glowing Mushroom cattails dropGlowing Mushroomswhen destroyed.
All lilypad variants.
Lily padsare plants that grow on the water's surface above suitable blocks. They are background objects and are destroyed by mostweaponsandtools.
There are 5 types of lily pads with 18 variants each adding up to a total of 90 lily pads. These are: Regular lily pads (aboveGrass), Jungle lily pads (aboveJungle grassandSand Blocksin anOasis), Hallowed lily pads (aboveHallowed grass), Corruption lily pads (aboveCorrupt grass) and Crimson lily pads (aboveCrimson grass).
Cacti seen in aDesert
Cactusgrows naturally onSand Blocksin theDesertbiome, and persists even if the Desert becomes infected withCorruption,Crimson, orHallow. They can be cut down with anyaxeand can be used to make cacti-themedweapons,armor,furniture, or just be placed and used as a building material. Occasionally, aPink Prickly Pearwill grow on top of a cactus. In1.3.5.3and before, mining the Sand Block underneath a cactus will cause the entire plant to drop, but since1.4.0.1this is no longer possible. Cactus will also damage you inThe Constantworlds
Jungle vegetationare plants that grow naturally onMud Blocksin theJungleandUnderground Junglebiomes.
Destroying vegetation in aSurfaceorUnderground JungleBiome has a chance to spawn variousBaitCrittersthat can be collected with theBug Net(Worm,Grasshopper,Grubby,Sluggy,Buggy).

All seaweeds variants
Seaweedsare plants that naturally grow onSand Blockssubmerged under water at theUndergroundlayer, most notably inOcean Caves.
All sea oats variants
Sea Oatsare plants that naturally grow onSand Blocksin theOasisandOceanbiomes.
Thorny bushesorthornsare plants that grow naturally and will damage any player on contact. There arefour /three /two types of thorny bushes:
Thorny bushes are destroyed after contact with aweapon,toolor the player, but invisible projectiles (Medusa Head,Life Drain, etc.) do not destroy them. AllNPCsandenemiesare immune to them, and they cannot be obtained as an item. Thorny bushes can grow six tiles in all directions, although their growth is blocked by solid objects and various other scenery. The purple and red variants spread the Corruption/Crimson; the brown variant, however, does not spread Jungle grass.
Naturally generated Sunflowers in aforest.
Sunflowersare surface plants that prevent the spread of theCorruption,Crimson(andHallow) on the blocks they are planted, and provide theHappy!buffto nearby players, mildly increasing movement speed and reducing enemy spawn rate.
Life fruit plant found in the jungle
Life Fruitsare consumables that permanently increase the player's maximumhealthby 5, up to a total of 500 (If 20 are used). They are found in theUnderground Jungleafter defeating at least onemechanical boss() / during Hardmode (). Life Fruits become more common once more mechanical bosses have been defeated. Life fruits will glow under the effect of spelunker potions.
Dye Plantscan be crafted intoDyesat aDye Vat. They can be encountered in various biomes, and show on the map.
Strange Plantsare uncommon quest items that can be traded with theDye Trader, who rewards the player with 1 out of 33 specialdyesin accordance to which bosses and/or events have been defeated. Only two dyes are notquest-exclusive(the player receives a quantity of 3 of the randomly chosen dye type).

It will summonPlanterawhen mined with a pickaxe/drill, broken by explosives, hit by aClentaminatorwithSolution, or if the jungle grass under it is hammered or converted to another block. Though it cannot be broken by other weapons or projectiles, caution should still be taken if these conditions are met to prevent any unwanted boss fights. One bulb will spawn about every six minutes (roughly one quarter of an in-game day.)

Player_stats,"Statistics, usually shortened tostats, are numerical properties that represent various aspects of a player (or rather, thecharacter) in an RPG setting. Stats determine how characters behave and how the game environment reacts to them. This page lists miscellaneous information regarding character stats inTerraria.
Seegame mechanicsfor a more generic list which also includes non-character stats.
Aggro, short for aggression, is an invisible statistic that determines the distance at which enemies will begin to attack the player.
Attack speed determines the frequency at which a character's weapon is used by alteringuse time.
When a player's head is submerged in aliquid, a Breath Meter appears directly above the player, representing the time the player has until they begindrowning.
Critical hit determines the character's chance of dealing additional damage when attacking.
The character's damage type depends on what kind of weapon is used.
Defense protects the player from damage. Normally, damage that a player takes is reduced by half of their defense value rounded up, but inExpert Mode75% of a player's defense applies instead, and 100% is applied in Master Mode. Players start with zero defense, but can gain more by equippingArmorandAccessories, as well as receiving bonuses from certainBuffs. If one's current defense would ordinarily block all incoming damage, they would instead take 1 point of damage.
Fall damage refers to the damage a player character sustains upon falling a large distance.
A player achieving maximum health and mana.
Health represents a player's ability to remain alive. All characters start with 100 Health, or five red hearts, upon creation. Health decreases when the player takesdamage; when the player reaches zero health, theydie. Players can increase their health through the use ofLife Crystalsto a maximum of 400, or 20 hearts. After this point,Life Fruitcan be used to convert red hearts into gold ones worth 25 health, making the natural cap 500 health. Health regenerates itself by default.
The character gains 20 Health for everyLife Crystalused. A maximum of 15 Life Crystals can be used per character, meaning a maximum of 400 Health for a character. The maximum life aPlayercan achieve is 500 with the use of theLife Fruit, but these can only be obtained inHardmode. This can be increased temporarily to 600 with theLifeforce Potion.
Knockback is a basic mechanic whereby characters and enemies are repelled in the opposite direction of an attack.
Mana is a player's spell-casting ability. Use ofMagic Weaponsdepletes the player's mana; if a player does not have enough mana to pay the cost of using a selected Magic Weapon, it cannot be used. All characters start with 20Manaupon creation, or one mana star, with each star being equal to 20 mana.Mana Crystalscan be used to increase mana by one star each, to a natural maximum of 200. This limit can further be increased by variousArmors,Accessories,Buffs, andModifiers, up to a maximum of 400. Mana regenerates itself by default.
Luck is a hidden statistic that influences the randomness of various activities.
Movement speed determines how quickly the player can travel around. AStopwatchcan display a rough estimate of the player's current movement speed. Many features can affect movement speed, such asMovement Accessories,Wings,Mounts,MinecartsandLiquids, along with certainBuffs,Debuffs,Armorand other hazards such asIce BlocksandCobwebs."
Potions,"Crafted potions and flasks (food items not included). Click to enlarge.
Potionsare consumableitemsthat either recover the user'shealthand/ormanaeither instantaneously or over time, or grant temporarybuffsordebuffsto the user. Potions are commonly found in naturalchestsandPots, can be dropped byenemies, purchased fromNPCs, or crafted. Most potions can be crafted at aPlaced BottleorAlchemy Table, but flasks must be crafted at anImbuing Station.
Potion buffs can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the buff icon (), by selecting the buff icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (), by selecting the buff with+/then canceling the buff with(), by double-tapping the buff icon (), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (). All potion buffs (including food buffs) are lost when dying, or when leaving and rejoining the world (as of 1.4.4, flasks stay).
InJourney Mode, all Potions require 20researchto unlock duplication, but 30 research is needed for recovery potions.

These potions restorehealth,mana, or even both at the same time. They are limited in use by thePotion SicknessandMana Sicknessdebuffs, respectively. The Potion Sickness debuff duration can be reduced with aCharm of Mythsor aPhilosopher's Stone.
Consuming foods will grant aWell Fed,Plenty Satisfied, orExquisitely Stuffedbuff, while drinks will grant theTipsyeffect.
These grant the character a temporary, usually short-lived buff when consumed. They are crafted at aPlaced Bottleor anAlchemy Table.Pressing the buff key (Quick Buffby default) will consume one of each of the player's buff potions in their inventory.
These grant the character a temporary melee and whips-specific buff when consumed. Only one flask buff can be active at a time. Crafted at anImbuing Station.

Princess,"ThePrincessis anNPCvendor that will spawn once the following conditions have been met:[1]
A princess named Yorai will spawn along with the player when starting aCelebrationmk10world, if the princess dies in a Celebrationmk10 world they can still respawn any time as long as there is a valid house available.
The Princess will attack nearby enemies with theResonance Scepterto defend herself (although the animation of the Scepter is not shown).

The Princess is unique in that she does not have any biome or neighbor preferences. She loves up to threeNPCsthat live nearby and is liked by all NPCs around her.
She also hates being lonely and her unhappiness is maxed to 150% if she is not surrounded by at least 2 other NPCs within 25 tiles, or 2 other NPCs that are between 25 and 120 tiles away.[2]
When submerged inShimmer, the Princess will transform into her Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. She can be returned to her classic look by submerging her in Shimmer again.

Pumpkin_Moon,"ThePumpkin Moonis aHardmode, post-Plantera,Halloweeneventsummoned with thePumpkin Moon Medallionany time atnight, ending at dawn (4:30AM). During the event, unique and highly difficult enemies spawn at high rates and attack the player. It is similar to theFrost Moonevent, but is less difficult. Visually, the moon turns into a jack-o-lantern, though remaining in its currentphase.
The entire event consists of 20 waves. Waves progress as the player reaches certain kill scores (though kill scores are not displayed to the player before wave 15). After a wave's required score is met, the next wave begins, and the kill score is reset to 0.Status messageswill indicate when the wave has advanced, and which wave has been achieved. See the tablebelowfor the points awarded for each enemy and the score required for each wave.
The Pumpkin Moon event always ends at 4:30AM. The goal of the event is to progress through all 20 wavesbeforethe event ends.
ThePumpkin Moon Medallion, which summons the Pumpkin Moon, requires materials only available inHardmodeworlds where the player has already defeatedPlantera(although it can still be summoned inpre-Hardmodeworlds). As such, it is intended to present a challenge even to players with mid-to-late Hardmode equipment. In the final waves, multipleboss-level enemies are fought at once.
Pumpkin Moon enemies drop powerfulweaponsandaccessories, as well aspetandvanity items. Most drop with extreme rarity, and even players who manage to complete the event will find they need to do so several times before obtaining them. Drop chances for items dropped by bosses increase as waves are completed. In the final wave, theMourning WoodandPumpkingare both guaranteed to drop their respective trophies.
Reaching the 15th wave before 4:30 AM will display the message “The spirit of Halloween penetrates the air...” at dawn (4:30 AM). For the entire day and night, all special effects of theHalloween seasonwill occur. At 4:30 AM of the next day, the message “The spirit of Halloween rests...” will appear and all Halloween events will no longer occur until the Halloween season begins again or the player reaches the 15th wave of the Pumpkin Moon again.[1]

Queen Bee has three distinct attack patterns:
InExpert Mode, the speed of these attacks increases as Queen Bee takes damage.
When fought outside of theUnderground Jungle, Queen Bee enrages, causing her movements to be more aggressive and firing stingers at a much faster rate.
When the queen bee is fought on the surfaceJungle, she enters an enraged state, attacking with more speed and aggression. This enraged state is increased if the player were to fight queen bee outside of the jungle altogether.

Rain,"I hope it doesn't rain again until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!
—The Painter
Rainoccurs randomly[1]and affects all surfacebiomesfor its duration. Each Rain event lasts for 24in-game hours(24 real-world minutes), spanning bothday and nightportions. When a player is in aSnow biomeduring Rain, it appears as aBlizzard, causing snowfall volume to increase. Rain also increases cloud cover.
Rain is primarily an aesthetic effect, only visible on thesurface: It displays Rain/Blizzard graphics, darkened ambient sun/moon light, and alteredmusic. There are however some functional effects.
Rain does not actually produce newwatertiles, does not cause existing water levels to rise, and has no effect onlavaorhoneytiles, but it does spawn some uniqueenemiesor enemy variants, and certaincrittersbehave differently. Some comical effects includeZombies wearing rain coats,Slimes carrying umbrellas, andGoldfishwalking upright on land, using their tail fins to casually shuffle about (swimming Goldfish will exit water and walk, and walking Goldfish will also spawn anew on land).
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,Old Chinese version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, rain has three different variations;Light Rain, regularRain, andHeavy Rain. The heavier the rainfall, the dimmer the sunlight will be, with Monsoon causing noticeable darkness. These variations are only graphical, can be detected with aWeather Radio, and can change multiple times throughout a single downpour.
Other effects include the following:

Ranged,"Ranged weaponsareweaponswhich are used in ranged combat. The defining trait of ranged weapons is generally their requirement ofammunitionin order for the weapon to operate.
Ranged weapons are roughly categorized intobows,repeaters,guns, andlaunchers. Note thatTerrariaclassifiesconsumableweapons as ranged weapons as well, andboomerangsasmelee weapons.
Due to the usage of ammo alongside the weapon, the totaldamageandknockbackvalues in effect during use are actually the sum of the weapon's stats combined with those of the ammo type used. A ranged weapon with a knockback value of zero, for example, will still usually apply some knockback, since nearly all ammunition types have their own knockback values.
The following lists present all ranged weapons along with their damage and how to acquire them. The intention of this is to convey an idea of their strength and the approximate time during gameplay at which they can be obtained. For a sortable list that displays all statistics of all ranged weapons, seeList of ranged weapons.








































These ranged weapons are unique in that they disappear upon use, and their ammunition count is determined by the quantity on hand.

























































The following items will boost the stats of Ranged weapons.



























"
Rarity,"Rarityis a property that applies to all items, loosely indicating their value and the difficulty through which they are obtained. An item's Rarity is indicated in-game by the color of its name text, as displayed, for example, when rolling the cursor over the item in aninventoryslot. An item's Rarity can be raised or lowered by up to two tiers depending on itsModifier.
Items from Blue to Purple, Gray, Rainbow, Fiery Red, and Amber, will not be destroyed upon contact withlava.
Any item with a Rarity of White will be destroyed when half-submerged inlava, with the following exceptions:
Click a rarity color to see a listing of items of that rarity.
(-12)
In the game code, these items contain other tier numbers, despite displaying the animated Rainbow rarity color in-game.
(-13)"
Recipes,"Craftingis the process of combiningmaterials(""ingredients"") into new items. It is one of the primary means of creating new weapons and tools and is thus generally indispensable for game progress. The entirety of an item's ingredients is called itsrecipe.
Crafting is done through the crafting bar, visible on the left side of the interface below the player'sinventory, which presents all craftable items available to the player. Items will only appear in this list if the player has the ingredients in their inventory. Pressing the⚒Use / Attackbutton on an item in the list will consume its required ingredients and place the item on the cursor, from which it can be placed in the inventory. Holding the⚷Interactbutton to craft a stackable item will begin to repeatedly produce the item until the stack is filled. Crafting takes no time, though there is a very small delay between the creation of items in a stack. The longer the button is held, the shorter this delay.
While many items can be crafted using only the materials in their recipes, most will require acrafting stationto make their recipe available. Items that require a station will appear in the crafting bar while the player stands near the required item, requiring no interaction with the station. In this way, a player may craft from multiple nearby stations at once."
Sandstorm,"The flying sand effect of a sandstorm
ASandstormis aneventwhich occurs randomly in theDesertwhenwind speed is above 30 mph. During this event, a few enemies often found in theUnderground Desertappear on the surface, as well asAngry Tumblersand, inHardmode,Sand ElementalsandSand Sharks. If the player is standing in the Desert while this event is active, theMighty Winddebuffwill be inflicted on the player if they are not in front of abackground wall.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, a Sandstorm has a 1/43200[1], (1/64800 in pre-Hardmode), chance of occurring per game tick[2]once the conditions are fulfilled.
On thetModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, a Sandstorm has a 1/51840 chance of occurring per game tick.
Prior to defeating theEye of Cthulhu, they are less common.
For the best chance for a Sandstorm to occur, it needs to beraining(18.2% chance per day - 24 minute duration), atnighttime (7:30PM - 4:30AM in game - 9 minute duration) andhave wind speeds above 30 mph.
During a Sandstorm, the background will turn a dusty yellow and a vignette will be applied to the player's screen. Particles of sand can also be seen flying across the screen. While the effects are amplified with Color and Whitelighting, which may be resource-intensive on some computers, using Retro or Trippy will remove much of the background dust."
Santa_Claus,"Santa Clausis aHardmodeNPCvendor that arrives after theFrost Legionhas been defeated, but only during theChristmasseason (December 15 – December 31 /December 1 – January 15), or unlocked for an in-game day outside of those dates by completing theFrost Moon), after which he dies. He sells many Christmas-themed decorations and vanities during this time.
Santa Claus will defend himself against nearbyenemiesby throwingbaubles.

When submerged inShimmer, the Santa Claus will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again.

Server,"A Terrariaserverprovides a platform for players to connect over the internet or other network formultiplayergames. Windows installations of Terraria include its server software. For running on a Linux distribution, you must download the server files. See the Downloads section.
A server can also be used for standalone single-player gameplay. This offers the ability to adjust the in-gametimeat will.
The server runs on TCP port 7777 by default. If you are behind NAT (e.g. residential user), the port used must beport-forwardedin order for other players be able to join. If one can't forward a port, one may choose to use a VPN service likeHamachiorRadmin VPNinstead (although in those cases, every player needs to install the VPN software). The default max players is 8 (16 as of1.4.0.1), but this can be changed during server start-up, as well as within the server configuration file (serverconfig.txt). Non-NAT connections(e.g. business or data center user) typically do not need port forwarding, but may need to allow the port through a firewall.
If running on a cloud service provider such as AWS or GCP, ensure port 7777 on TCP and UDP is open to allow connections to the server.
Servers can be found via these server lists:
A server can be joined by selecting the Multiplayer option on the main menu, selecting a character, and then entering the server's IP and port.
Often different servers have different requirements for a player to join. Some servers will require the player to have aSoftcoreorMediumcoreplayer to play, and some may require that players be at a certain level of the game before joining. Often a public server will have a /register and /login system where the player must have a character with both a unique name and password.
Public servers also usually are run by a group of Administrators and/or Moderators who enforce or regulate rules. Often these rules will disallow mods and hacks, impersonation, and the like. Some servers may also have the capability to allow a player to play online with their singleplayer character without losing their singleplayer inventory.
A list of servers you have recently played will be saved under ""Join via IP"" in Multiplayer.
A player then may join the server from the game menu by choosing the Multiplayer option.
First we will install the tools we need to run the server. These are likely preinstalled on your distribution.
For a Debian based system (Ubuntu), run:sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wget tmux unzip
Tmux is a modern version of screen that allows multiple virtual terminal instances. We will use it to launch the server in the background.
Since you can use command line parameters with./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64you can also run a Terraria server as a systemd service. It can be helpful if you want to run a Terraria server on VDS (DigitalOcean, Lenode & etc.).
Lets assume that you have a VDS with linux distro on it. You also have a non-root user namedterrariafor example. In terraria's home directory you have unzipped Terraria server. It's1449on the moment of writing.
Since we running the service with--userflag it binds to user's session. That means it will starts after user logged in and will stops when user logged out. In most cases this behavior is okey, but we do not want to be logged in to server in order to play. So to allow our service to start when system boots up, we need to enable special flag for our user.
We need to relogin as root user and runloginctl enable-linger terrariaorsudo loginctl enable-linger terrariaif you use user who part of sudories group. After that you can check if changes were applied by runningloginctl show-user terrariain the end of output you should see a lineLinger=yes. After that you good to go: restart your VDS and that try to connect to it from the game. The service now should start immediately after VDS go online and you should be able to connect to it from the game.
If you alter SystemD unitterraria.service, for example change port or path to the world file, you will need to reload systemd daemon before you start the changed service. To avoid this reload you can store values as environment variables.
Next time when you will change values inside.envyou will need only to restart the service.
If you are upgrading a Terraria server to different version you also can store path to executable in.envfile. Or you can use a symbolic link. In that case you will need only to remove old symbolic link, create new one and than restart the service.
After that yourterraria.servicewill look like this:
If you are using an operating system (Such as Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) or FreeBSD) that does not come with a prebuilt executable, you could usemonoto start the server. This could be useful if you want to host a server on a device such as aRaspberry Pi, or any device that does not run on the x86 architecture.
NOTE: If you are using a non-x86 Linux-based operating system (Such as Raspberry Pi OS), the first few instructions should be the same as the one foundhere, up until thechmodcommand. You would need to installmonoand and any other required libraries (such assqliteorscreen) if it does not come preinstalled on your system.
The server should run as expected.
If you encounter an error saying""Your mono runtime and class libraries are out of sync."", navigate within the Terraria directory and remove monoconfig, mscorlib.dll, and any files that begin with ""Mono"" or ""System"".
Example instructions with Linux:
WindowsBase.dll and FNA.dll should be the only .dll files in the directory
NOTE: This procedure will delete any other files starting with ""Mono"" or ""System"", so keep that in mind!
The vanilla Terraria server software is included with the regular Terraria package (see above), but can also be downloaded:
Dedicated Server GUI is a third-party add-on for the vanilla server that offers graphical controls (the server is normally a command-line program):
Tshockand TDSM are third-party server packages that offer additional functionality, such as in-game commands, whitelists, player passwords, and a plugin interface for added features (such as factions):
The Windows server consists of these files:
Once a dedicated server is running, the following commands can be run:
Note that a forward-slash/isnotrequired to precede the command, as some command interfaces require. For a list of Tshock commands, refer tothe TShock readme.
The following is a list of parameters that can be entered when running TerrariaServer initially:
It is possible to start the dedicated server using a configuration file that enters the above parameters automatically. The config file must be called using the -config parameter. The file can have any name, but must be in the same folder as TerrariaServer.exe. If a server config file is defined and the file is not located during the server boot, then the server will ask the user to input the parameters as it would if run without a defined config file.
The following is a list of available config commands:
Comment lines can be included using the hash symbol (#). Lines that begin with # will be skipped entirely.
The commandban <player>will ban the indicated player from the server. A banned player, when they try to login, will be displayed the message:You are banned for [duration]: [reason]- [modname]. A banned player may then be un-banned by editing the file ""banlist.txt,"" which is located in the Terraria folder. This document contains a list of all currently banned players. To un-ban a player, delete the player's name and IP address from the list.
An easy method of installing .NET and XNA is to simply install the Terraria client, which should install both as part of its regular installation.
Below are instructions for a very basic LAN party setup. At the very least, all computers must be connected to the same network for this to work. If you feel so inclined, you can set the server to have a static LAN IP address, but that's not really necessary. Note that these instructions are targeted at people who have little to no networking experience, and just want to play games."
Skeleton_Merchant,"A Skeleton Merchant found lurking in theCavern.
TheSkeleton Merchantis anNPCvendor that randomly spawns in theCavernlayer.
He is not a Town NPC and will despawn when off-screen, although enemies will not spawn near him.
The Skeleton Merchant's stock changes atdawn(4:30AM) daily, and he does not need to respawn for it to do so. The majority of the items in his inventory will vary, depending on the currentmoon phase.
He will throwBonesto fend off nearby non-skeletal enemies, while ignoring bosses. He will also avoid most skeletons, though he can still be damaged by an ""Angry Bones"" projectile in expert mode or above.
Unlike other NPCs, the Skeleton Merchant does not have a map icon. AHunter Potionwill highlight him.
He is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.His current name will be displayed (e.g. Rattles Magoo) rather thanSkeleton Merchant.

When submerged inShimmer, the Skeleton Merchant will transform into his Shimmered form. This has no impact on gameplay or dialogue and is only a visual change. He can be returned to his classic look by submerging him in Shimmer again.

Skeletron,"Skeletronis apre-Hardmodeboss. It must be defeated prior to entering theDungeon, and defeating it grants unlimited access to all Dungeon areas for all players. It also causes theClothierNPCto spawn, as long as a vacanthouseis available.
If attempting to enter the Dungeon before killing Skeletron,Dungeon Guardiansspawn once a player reaches 0depth.[1]These enemies generally kill any player with a single hit, dealing 1000 /2000/3000damage. Managing to defeat a Dungeon Guardian does not grant access to the Dungeon, thus defeating Skeletron is mandatory for (safely) entering the Dungeon.
While Skeletron is alive, the musicBoss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 1 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
Skeletron is summoned by speaking to theOld Manat the Dungeon's entrance atnight, who will turn into Skeletron when selecting the""Curse""option. If the Old Man is spoken to during the day, he will ask the player to return at night. Skeletron can only be summoned once per night, as the Old Man will not respawn until dawn. While players with less than 300 maximumhealthand/or less than 10defenseare deemed too weak by the Old Man to lift his curse, he still offers the option to summon Skeletron.
Skeletron can be summoned repeatedly this way until it is defeated. Once it is defeated, the Old Man's curse will be lifted and he will no longer appear. Skeletron can be re-summoned thereafter once the player acquires theClothier Voodoo Doll(fromAngry BonesorDark Casters), then by attacking and killing theClothierduring night.
Killing the Clothier usingFlymealwill not summon Skeletron unless the Clothier Voodoo Doll is equipped.
Skeletron is a large floating skull with two independent floating hands. All parts can travel throughblocks, and will attempt to make contact with the player to inflict damage. Each part can be killed independently, but killing the head is all that is required to defeat Skeletron.
Skeletron alternates between two attack phases:
Skeletron switches between these two phases in a regular cycle during the entire fight, with the first phase lasting for roughly 13.33 seconds and the second phase lasting for roughly 6.67 seconds. It lets out aroarhttps://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Roar_0.wavevery time it enters the second phase.
If the player takes too long to kill it anddawnarrives, Skeletron will begin acting exactly as aDungeon Guardian, performing a head spin attack with very high damage and gaining enough defense to only absorb 1 damage from all attacks, which will usually kill any players remaining in the vicinity quickly (it is still possible to kill it, but players are at an extreme disadvantage unless it only has a miniscule amount of health). Skeletron remains in this form until dying or despawning, even if players manage to avoid dying until the following dusk.
Skeletron has additional properties inExpert Mode:

Skeletron_Prime,"Skeletron Primeis aHardmodemechanical bosswhich is essentially a more difficult version ofSkeletron. It consists of a head and four limbs, but, similarly to Skeletron, only the head needs to be defeated to defeat the boss.
Skeletron Prime can be summoned manually using aMechanical Skullatnight(7:30PM to 4:30AM). It also has a10*1/10 (10%)chance to spawn naturally at dusk once aDemon or Crimson Altarhas been destroyed, as long as it has not yet been defeated at least once in the current world. If spawning this way, its arrival is announced by thestatus message""The air is getting colder around you..."".
If Skeletron Prime is not defeated by dawn, it will behave much like aDungeon Guardian: It will cease using its limbs and instead charge at the player at extremely high speeds, dealing usually lethal damage upon contact.
While Skeletron Prime is alive, the musicBoss 1https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_1.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
Skeletron Prime's head constantly endeavors to remain between 31.5 and 12.5 tiles above the player and within 6.25 tiles of either side of the player. It can accelerate infinitely in order to move back into this area. The head does not actively attempt to make contact with the player.[1]
Skeletron Prime's four limbs all have unique attacks:
Every 10 seconds, Skeletron Prime will enter a spinning phase for 6.67 seconds, in which its attacks become more aggressive:
Upondawn(4:30AM), Skeletron Prime will enrage and permanently behave like a fasterDungeon Guardian, increasing its velocity[5]and usually killing the player instantly if touched: its damage increases to 1000 and its defense raises up to 9999.[1]It will remain in this state until defeated, even if it becomes night again. If defeated, it will drop items normally.
If the player is more than 375 tiles away, Skeletron Prime will start moving downwards and will quickly despawn.[1]

Slime_Rain,"King Slimespawning during Slime Rain. Note the falling slimes in the background.
Slime Rainis a minoreventthat consists of frequent spawns ofGreen,BlueandPurple Slimeand rarelyPinky. It occurs randomly, signaling its beginning with the message""Slime is falling from the sky!"". Slime Rain continues until 150 slimes have been defeated, at which pointKing Slimewill spawn. If King Slime has previously been defeated, he will spawn after only 75 slimes have been defeated. The event ends shortly after he is defeated or despawns. All slime spawns from the event will be continuously hostile, unlike naturally spawned slimes.
A Slime Rain can only occur if at least one player in the world has over 140 maximumhealthand 8defense(except inExpert Mode, where it can occur before meeting the criteria – with a significantly decreased chance). Given those criteria, a Slime Rain has an approximate 4.9% of chance of occurring in apre-Hardmodeworld per day (approx. 3.3% inHardmode). If King Slime has not been killed yet, the probability for a Slime Rain to occur is doubled.
While a Slime Rain is active, Green, Blue, and Purple Slimes will appear to fall in the background. The event can last anywhere from 9 to 15 in-game hours. If the player fails to defeat 150 / 75 slimes by the end of the Slime Rain, the message""Slime has stopped falling from the sky.""will appear and the Slime Rain will end naturally without King Slime spawning. The event will not end if the player leaves the world, that even resets the time of the event."
Snow_biome,"TheSnow biome, also known as theTundra, is aSurfacebiomethat takes on an arctic appearance with its constant snowfall, its ground made ofSnowandIce Blocks, and itsboreal trees. It can be of moderate difficulty in the early game, becoming relatively easy with some basic equipment. The biome is always found in the direction of theDungeon, opposite theUnderground DesertandJungle. It extendsUndergroundand transitions to theIce biomein theCavernlayer.
Specific features of the Snow biome include a differentwatercolor and a snowscape background. Boreal trees andShiverthornfrequently grow in the snow.Penguinswander the surface, and typicalenemiesincludeIce Slimes,Frozen Zombies, andDemon Eyes. Stepping in water in the Snow biome inExpertorMaster Modeinflicts the player with theChilleddebuffuntil 5 seconds after they leave. Duringrain, the biome undergoes ablizzard, decreasing visibility.
The trees in the biome can appear to be pines, snowy evergreens, or leafless trees, but they always yieldBoreal Woodwhen cut down.Acornsplaced on Snow Blocks always grow into boreal trees.
A Snow biome is made of at least1500 /300 Snow or Ice Blocks nearby, causing the water color and the background to change, but Snow plants and enemies can spawn on even a single block of snow or ice.
TheCorruption,Crimson, andHallowcan overtake this biome through its Ice Blocks, either upon world generation or thanks to improvedbiome spreadinHardmode.
During aBlood Moon, Penguins becomeCorruptorVicious.
InHardmode, the Snow biome gets a bit of a boost.Ice ElementalsandWolvesbegin to spawn at night, and blizzards can spawn the rareIce Golem, a recurring lumbering giant with a frost beam attack thatchillsand evenfreezesplayers. Also, any enemy killed in the Snow biome in Hardmode has a0.33*1/300 (0.33%)chance of dropping theAmarok, a powerfulyoyothat inflicts theFrostburndebuff on enemies.
TheDungeonholds a singleIce Chest, which is unlocked with aFrozen Key, obtainable from the Snow biome at any time, but is only usable afterPlanterais defeated. Any enemy killed in the Snow biome has a0.04*1/2500 (0.04%)chance of dropping the Frozen Key (onPC,Console,Mobile,Old Chinese,tModLoader, andtModLoader Legacy) or theFrozen Key Mold(onOld-gen console,Windows Phone, and3DS). The Ice Chest holds theStaff of the Frost Hydra, asentrysummon weapon.

Atlantic Cod is used to craftCooked Fishand Frost Minnow is used to craftWarmth Potions, which reduce damage from cold-themed enemies by 30% and are very useful in the Snow biome. Frost Daggerfish areranged/throwing weaponsand can be useful at the beginning of the game.Frozen CratesandBoreal Cratescan also be caught in the Snow biome in pre-Hardmode and Hardmode, respectively, and always include one item fromFrozen Chests(alongside other loot).

The 55 functional statues can be further categorised into 3 subtypes: 26 enemy statues, 21 critter statues and 8 other statues. These statues can bewiredand activated to spawnenemies, drop items, or teleport a randomNPCto their location. Statue-spawned enemies do not dropcoins. Before the 1.4 update they generally would drop their other usual items at a reduced rate, with the exception of theMimic, which does not drop any items whatsoever other than itsbanner, obtained after the designated amount of kills. Since the 1.4 update, this is only the case with certain statues. Aside from normal items, Slimes, Crabs, and Wall Creepers spawned from statues may also drop hearts and mana stars, potentially granting an alternative source of health and mana. Since the effects of the Life Drain and Vampire Knives work on spawned enemies, the player can build a pit with any timer spawning weak enemies to recover health during a boss fight. Statues found inUnderground Cabinsmay be connected toPressure Plates, and can easily spawn enemies that may kill early game players.
Seespawn limits (below)for limitations that apply to functional statues.
Bomb, Heart, and Star Statues will not produce anything if there are already 10 of their item in the world, regardless of origin, or if 3 of their item is present within 16 tiles. Boulder Statues can only spawn a boulder every 15 seconds.
Decorative statues have no function and only serve as decoration. They are generally found placedunderground. The three Lihzahrd statues are only found in theJungle Temple, and are the only statues that do not appear to be made of stone. The Angel Statue is sometimes found inchests. The Armor Statue can also be crafted with50at aWork Bench. OnPC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, an Angel Statue can be thrown intoshimmerto obtain theAether Monolith.

These are crafted at theHeavy Work Benchwith50each.
Entities within range count towards spawn limit.
Activation of a spawning statue willnotproduce an item/character if a certain quantity of that entity already exists within a certain range. The range boundary is a circle, centered on the statue's spawning point.
All statues (even those that appear shorter) have a footprint of 6 tiles (2 × 3). Each of these 6 tiles could be used as a wire input. Since the1.3update, each input shares the cooldown period with each other after activation. During an input's cooldown, activations from anytrigger devices(Switches,Timers,Pressure Plates) will be ignored. For enemy and critter statues, this cooldown lasts exactly 0.5 seconds. Item statue inputs have a 10 second cooldown.
Creatures spawned by Bunny, Fish, and Penguin Statues during aBlood Moonwill immediately become corrupted.Corrupt Bunny,Corrupt Goldfish, andCorrupt Penguin(and their Crimson counterpart) enemies do not count against the spawn limits, allowing quicker farming. The same is true of Goldfish which start walking duringrain, and Explosive Bunnies from Bunny Statues inFor the worthyworlds. Another exception is theBomb Statue, sinceBombsmay group together into stacks of up to 99 and each stack counts as a single entity.
Bunny and Squirrel statues will spawn their usual critters in a Cavern town, not Gem Critters."

Summon_weapons,"Summon weaponsare a type ofweaponthat spawns secondary characters that will aid the player during battle by automatically attackingenemieswithin range. They dealsummon damageand cannot be hurt or killed.
The characters spawned by most summon weapons fall into one of two categories:minionsandsentries. Minions are mobile characters that follow the player, while sentries remain stationary. Additionally, the set bonuses of theStardust armor,Chlorophyte armor, andForbidden armorwill summon an entity to fight for the player in a manner similar to minions.
Whipsare related weapons that deal summon damage without summoning any minions. Hitting an enemy with awhipcauses a player's minions and sentries to target it immediately. Some whips have bonus effects which can be activated by minions, but not by sentries.
There are currently 26 summon weapons on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, 19 on theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, 11 on theOld-gen console versionandWindows Phone version, and 5 on theNintendo3DSversion.
Minionsare mobile characters. They follow the player indefinitely until the player: dies, summons a replacement minion, manually cancels theirbuff, or exits the world.  There are several different minions available, some of which can walk or fly, and attack using melee or ranged means. A minion costsmanato summon initially, but follows the player indefinitely thereafter at no further cost.
Minions provide an ongoing source of damage against enemies which requires little or no attention from the player. The common limit of all minions is that each has a limited rate of attack and damage, but the different types also have various limits to their movement and/or attacks.
Minions follow players in a manner similar topets, flying and passing throughblocksas necessary to keep pace with the player's movements, though most cannot move through blocks for the purposes of attacking. Exceptions are the minions summoned byAbigail's Flower,Tempest Staff,Xeno Staff,Desert Tiger Staff,Stardust Dragon Staff,Blade Staff,Sanguine Staff, andTerraprisma, all of which can attack through blocks.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version,tModLoader version, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, it is possible to press⚷Interactwith a minion-summoning item. This will direct the respective minion to target the entity nearest to the cursor. As long as the minions have their target within their line of sight, they will specifically attack it.The targeted enemy will show swirling white curves on it.The targeted enemy will show swirling purple particles which will trail behind a moving enemy, or circle in front of a stationary one (see images).
By default, a player can only have a single minion summoned at once. Various boosts can raise the player's minion capacity (""slots""), allowing multiple simultaneous minions. With minion cap boosts in effect, the same minion can be summoned multiple times, or several different minions can be summoned. Minion cap boosts do not affect pets orlight pets. If the minion cap later drops below the number of minions in use, minions are randomly chosen and dismissed until the number of minions is below the current cap. Minions vanish when their player leaves the world, and are not re-summoned when the player re-enters that or another world.
TheSpider Staff(onOld-gen console,Windows Phone,Old Chinese, andtModLoader Legacy),Optic Staff, Stardust Dragon Staff,Abigail's Flower, andDesert Tiger Staffhave special minion capacity logic. See their pages for details.
Sentriesare stationary characters. Unlike minions, sentries do not follow the player, and will instead remain rooted in place. In normal use, sentries will last for a fixed ten minutes before vanishing; unlike minions, they can persist even after their owner dies. During theOld One's Armyevent, this time limit does not apply (seebelowfor details).
By default, a player can only have a single sentry summoned at once.Tavernkeep armor and Old One's Army accessories (see below) can raise the player's sentry capacity, allowing multiple simultaneous sentries. Note that these accessories donotstack with each other, so the maximum sentry limit is 6: 1 by default, +1 from an accessory, +1 from a War Table, and +3 from armor. With sentry cap boosts in effect, the same sentry can be summoned multiple times, or several different sentries can be summoned. On theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version, andNintendo3DSversion, the player is limited to only summoning one of each sentry type, with no way to raise the cap.
A waiting sentry goes into a reuse cooldown after attacking, before it can try to attack again. This cooldown is bypassed initially on summoning, which can dramatically increase sentry attack speed at the cost of greater mana expense. Since sentries do not suffer fromMana Sickness, this can be a viable way to deliver high damage at long range when using a sentry that attacks instantly.
Sentries summoned by items from theTavernkeepare associated with theOld One's Armyevent. They are purchased withDefender Medals(instead ofcoins), which are awarded only during the event. At first, they can only be used within the event, where they will remain placed until the end of the event. Each sentry summoned will cost 10Etherian Mana; at the beginning of the event, the player immediately gets the 10 Etherian Mana for their first sentry, and can collect more as they kill enemies.  Sentries summoned with Etherian Mana are not subject to sentry limits (see above).  Other sentries can be used in the event, but will have their usual mana cost, duration, and sentry limits.
Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: Rod, Cane, and Staff; with the Staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The Tavernkeep's various armor sets each enhance one of his four sentry types; see his article for full details.
After the event is completed once, these can be used outside the event, and will then function as normal sentries, costing ordinarymanato summon (5 points per tier) and lasting the usual two minutes. Etherian Mana cannot be used outside the event, so the usual sentry limits apply:  By default only one sentry can be summoned at once, butarmorsold by the Tavernkeep, and accessories dropped by event bosses such asOgres, can raise a player's sentry limit. This limit increasedoesinclude non-Tavernkeep sentries such as the Queen Spider.  Again, the accessories do not stack with each other.
Whipsare unlike other summon weapons, and instead act more like a traditional weapon. When used, whips will perform a normal attack which costs no mana, swiping in a wide cone towards the cursor or wherever aimed. Whips deal summon damage, and as such cannot dealcritical hits. All whips can pierce infinitely in their range, but will deal progressively less damage to each additional enemy they hit, until they start dealing 1 damage. Whips all vary in size as well. The severity of damage loss from piercing and the size of whips typically goes down and up, respectively, as whips get stronger.
Despite being summon weapons, whips are affected by some effects which only work onmelee weapons, only get meleemodifiers, and have a limited range like melee weapons. Whips are affected by any boosts to melee speed (such asFeral Clawsand its upgrades), as well asflasksand theautoswingtoggle feature. Whips are not affected by boosts to melee damage or theTitan Glove's boost to melee weapon size.
A feature of whips is how they make minions and summons target the enemy hit, the same way that other summon weapons can target enemies. Whips can only target enemies by hitting them, unlike those other summon weapons. The enemy targeted will always be the last enemy hit by the whip, usually the furthest enemy away from the player that gets hit.
The main feature of whips is their summon tag damage, which increases the damage of each minion hit by a set amount. Two endgame whips also feature summon tag critical strike chance, which enables summons to deal critical hits. This summon tag critical strike chance cannot be increased by any other boosts to critical strike chance. Summon tag effects will affect both minions and sentries.
Some whips feature uniquebuffsanddebuffs, aside from the common debuffs ofPoisonedandOn Fire!that two whips can inflict. Two whips feature debuffs which activate an effect when the enemy with the debuff is hit by a minion.These two debuffs are also universal; even universally immune enemies likeThe Destroyercan be affected by whip debuffs. The buffs that whips have are mostly boosts to melee speed, which get progressively more potent for stronger, later whips. These melee speed buffs are not exclusive to the whips that grant them, and will actually affect not only other whips, but also melee weapons in general. TheCool Whipcurrently features the only buff that does not affect melee speed; its buff creates a damaging projectile that lasts for 3 seconds after the last time the whip hit something.

Additionally, any accessories which boost melee speed also boost whip speed, and the autoswing property ofFeral Clawsand its upgrades applies to whips. There are some melee accessories which have small boosts only to whips, not to the summons themselves.





Aggro effects make this better in singleplayer, where aggro doesn't matter.

(Boost only activates atNightor during aSolar Eclipse)
(Does not stack with Celestial Shell)

The maximum possible minion capacity is 11. It requires equippingStardust armor(not counting its Stardust Guardian), thePapyrus Scarab,Necromantic Scroll, andPygmy Necklaceaccessories while being under the effects of theSummoning Potionand theBewitching Table.
Note that damage is calculated in a two-step process. First the weapon damage itself is adjusted for the weapon modifier (and rounded to the nearest integer). Only after that are all other modifiers added and applied to the weapon damage.
Damage bonuses only need to be active while actually summoning the minions. This allows summoning some minions at maximum damage, and then unequipping some of the damage bonus for limit increases, to summon more minions at slightly lower damage.
Update 1.4.0.1 changes the damage bonus to be calculated concurrently, meaning any damage bonus that is removed while a minion is active will be removed from the minion. Thus, the following loadout is no longer useful as a ""setup"" procedure, though it remains a powerful summoner build.
ARuthless modifieron the minion-summoning staff yields +18% up front.
Other modifiers can be maximized as follows:
Total maximum: +224% (+273%). On top of the bonus for a Ruthless weapon, this will yield approximately +282% (+340%).
To achieve ""maximum minion power"" in single-player, follow the following procedure. (auto-pausewill help a lot; comments about extra spiders should be ignored as of 1.4.):"
Tavernkeep,"The Unconscious Man in aforest.
TheTavernkeepis a uniqueNPCvendor that accepts onlyDefender Medalsas currency for most items, instead ofcoins. He will only become accessible after the player has defeated theEater of WorldsorBrain of Cthulhu. Once this criteria is met, he will appear as anUnconscious Manspawning in anylayerof the world. Similar to other bound NPCs, talking to him allows him to claim ahouseand respawn when killed.
TheTavernkeep's sentry summon weaponsare associated with theOld One's Armyevent, and at first can only be used within that event. They function elsewhere only after the event is completed once successfully. Each of the Tavernkeep's sentry summon weapons come in three tiers: rod, cane, and staff, with the staff being the most expensive and the most powerful. The armor he sells also associates each sentry type with a specific class: Ballista formelee(tank-style), Flameburst formagic, Explosive forrangers, and Lightning Aura for ""speedy melee"" (forsummoners).  The Tavernkeep will give each player 5 medals for free, to buy their first sentry; all future medals must be earned by defeating at least some waves of the Old One's Army.
When threatened, he throws mugs ofAleat enemies, dealing 24 /36/42damage at the start of the game, and (on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version) as players progress he will gainvarious stat increases.[1]. On all versions he may also drop anAle Tosserupon death, allowing the player to perform the same attack.
The Unconscious Man is one of the few entities that can be detected by theLifeform Analyzeror its upgrades.
Note:While the prices of the first six listed items (those bought byCoins) can be decreased by equipping aDiscount CardorGreedy Ring, and, on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, are affected by the NPC'shappiness level, the rest of the stock always costs a fixed amount ofDefender Medals.

Terraria(/təˈrɛ.ri.ə/[1]) is a video game developed byRe-Logic. It was first released initially for Windows on May 16, 2011, but has since expanded to several other platforms. The game is a 2Daction-adventure,open-world sandbox/platformerin which the player controls a single character in a pre-generated world.
Both single-player and multi-player are supported. Besides English, the in-game language can be set to German, Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Polish. The gameplay has several similarities to the well-knownMinecraftand was partially inspired by it.[2]However, there are also a large number of differences, like its severalbossesandevents.
It has been announced that a follow-up,Terraria 2, is planned for the future. A spin-off of the game calledTerraria: Otherworldwas under development, but was officially canceled on April 12, 2018.
Terrariais the world's 10th most sold video game, with over 44 million sold copies as of May 2022, including paid mobile downloads.[3][4]
Terrariais purchased via a one-time-payment. Updates are free afterward. The price differs between game versions (see below) but generally ranges between US$5-20. Various sales occasionally lower the price, to as low as US$1.99.[5]Some platforms also offer trial/demo versions.
There is also aCollector's EditionandSpecial Editionwhich may cost slightly more but include additional merchandise.
Terrariais available on multiple PC, console, and mobile platforms, but this wiki distinguishes between the five main versions; the old generation as well as the following four versions.
TheDesktop versionis the most extensive, featuring nearly everything ever introduced toTerraria. Traditionally being limited toWindows, the official release ofTerrariaonmacOSandLinuxplatforms on August 12th, 2015 and further expanded the computer versions game from being just Windows-only.[6]The Windows version costs US$9.99 on Steam.
ThetModLoader versionof the game is equivalent to , while thetModLoader Legacy version is equivalent to 1.3.5.3.
On this wiki, entries that regard content exclusive to the PC version will be marked with, or the banner:
TheConsole versionsofTerrariaare split in terms of extensivity. TheXbox One,Nintendo Switch, and thePlayStation 4editions of the game are equivalent to Desktop1.4.4.9. TheXbox 360,PlayStation 3,PlayStation Vita, andWii Ueditions of the game are equivalent to Desktop1.2.4.1, and also lack content found on the Desktop and Mobile versions. These versions are not planned to be updated past the 1.2.4.1 equivalent.
On this wiki, theXbox One,andNintendo Switch editions are referred to as the ""Console version"" and will be marked with. (Note that theSwitch version may have a separate section in the history section due to its differences with the primary console version, like 1.4.0.5 for the Switch released January 4, 2022 while the Xbox/PS4 version of 1.4.0.5 released September 30, 2021) Content exclusive to theXbox 360,,, andWii U editions are referred to as the ""Old-gen console version"" and will be marked with.

A newly created character in aforest.
Players begin by creating acharacter, and then aworld. Multiple characters and multiple worlds can be created. World generation is based on random seeds, so two worlds are generally never the same. The game starts with the character spawning in the middle of their new world, armed with aCopper Shortswordfor protection (aWooden Swordin theWindows Phone versionandNintendo3DSversion), aCopper Pickaxefor mining, and aCopper Axefor gatheringwood. The player is then encouraged to gather resources (such asore), build abasefor defense againstenemies, and generally overcome various game challenges. Hints to aid the game progression are provided by theGuideNPCwho spawns nearby.
The game includes a wide array of features. Players will generally be spending their time exploring, building things, collecting/creating items (mainly for empowering the character),fishing, and fighting monsters andbosses. AsTerrariais asandbox game, players are not locked into working towards any singular goal and can decide for themselves what to pursue. One popular goal is to make one's character as strong as possible and ultimately defeat the game's hardest bosses andevents, such as theMoon Lord.
A hardmode character fighting off thePirate Invasionevent.
Terrariacan also be played inmulti-player, in which more than one character can play in the same world. Multi-player games are either cooperative games where players work together to build things or overcome challenges as in single-player or competitivePvPgames where players or teams fight against each other.
Thetimesystem ofTerrariaisreal-time, the in-game time furthermore cycling betweenday and night. The game can, however, be paused (in single-player), but only if theautopauseoption is enabled in thesettings. It is also possible to save and exit the game whenever desired and resume later. However, the character will teleport back to theirspawn point.
On Metacritic, Terraria received ""generally favorable"" review getting a metascore of 81/100 on both PS3[9]and Xbox 360,[10]82/100 on both iOS[11]and Nintendo Switch,[12]83/100 on both PC[13]and PS4,[14]84/100 on Xbox One,[15]and 85/100 on PS Vita.[16]
On Steam, Terraria was ""Overwhelmingly Positive"".[17]"

The_Corruption,"In a new world, Corruption can extend into theSnow biome.Purple Icewill not spread Corruption untilHardmode.
In a new world, Corruption can extend into theDesert.Ebonsandwill not spread Corruption until Hardmode.
The Corruptionis anevil biomewith a dark purple wasteland, death, and decay theme, with an evil forest design to it, in contrast to the red gore theme of its counterpart,The Crimson. Every world will contain one of the two, generated randomly (with the Corruption having a 45% chance of generating and the Crimson having a 55% chance of generating) or chosen by the player upon world creation (only after theWall of Fleshhas been defeated in any world). Both contain similar hazards and feature their own uniqueenemies,items, andblocks. Thetools,weapons, andarmorobtained via Corruption materials are generally faster, but slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials. Corruption enemies tend to have slightly lower stats, such as health, defense, and damage. Water here is also purple.
The Corruption contains multiplechasms, underground extensions of the biome. Chasms lead downwards in a straight line, some crossing a horizontal connector, ending with aShadow Orb.Demon Altarsgenerally line the chasm's passages, appearing inside and around it. Chasms consist ofEbonstone, which can be blown up byexplosives, mined with aNightmare/Deathbringer Pickaxeor higher, or purified toStoneby usingPurification Powderor theClentaminator.
The Corruption spreads, meaning it slowly converts adjacent tiles to their Corruption variants. Seebelowfor details. Chasms, Demon Altars, and Shadow Orbs will only appear upon world generation, and will not spawn in a Corruption area that has formed through spreading. If enough Corruption manages to take over a new area, then that area will eventually adopt the Corruption's theme music, background, and water color. For an area to be considered a Corruption biome, at least300 /200 tiles ofCorrupt grassor Corruption blocks must be present.
The Corruption spreads itself, similar to theCrimsonandHallowbiomes. This means that it slowly converts certain susceptible tiles, which are in the vicinity of existing Corrupt blocks. While its spreading capabilities are very limited during pre-Hardmode, it spreads much faster and more aggressively after defeating theWall of Flesh. DefeatingPlanterafor the first time reduces the speed of the Corruption's spread by50*1/2 (50%).
A CorruptedDesert.
In Hardmode, Corruption spreads throughDeserts, transforming them into Corrupted Deserts. A Corrupted Desert is fairly similar to a regular patch of Corruption: The theme music and enemies are the same, with the addition ofDark Mummieson the surface andDark Lamias,Vile GhoulsandDesert Spiritsin theundergroundwithBone BitersDuring aSandstorm.
Sandis replaced byEbonsand. Cacti drop ordinarycactuswhen cut, even though they have a different color.Waterleafis unable to grow in Corrupted Deserts.

Thorny bushesgrowing in the grass.
The Crimsonis anevil biomewith a fleshy infection, red gore theme, in contrast to the dark purple wasteland theme of its counterpart,the Corruption. Every world will contain one of the two generated randomly except for special seeds (Corruption 45%, Crimson 55%) orchosen by the player upon world creation (only after theWall of Fleshhas been defeated in any world). Both contain similar hazards and feature their own uniqueenemies,items, andblocks. Thetools,weapons, andarmorobtained via Crimson material generally have minor advantages over those obtained via Corruption materials; however, Corruption tools are slightly faster. Crimson enemies tend to have slightly higher stats, such as health, defense, and damage.
The Crimson contains multiplechasms, extensions of the biome into the underground. Every chasm has an entrance on the surface and leads to a large, circular cavity, then branches off into small ""fingers"" which end with aCrimson Heart.Crimson Altarsgenerally line the chasm's passages, appearing inside and around it. Chasms consist ofCrimstone, which can be blown up byexplosives, mined with aNightmare/Deathbringer Pickaxeor higher, or purified toStoneby usingPurification Powder.

A CrimsonDesert.
In Hardmode, Crimson spreads throughDeserts, transforming them into Crimson Deserts. A Crimson Desert is fairly similar to a regular patch of Crimson: The theme music and enemies are the same, with the addition of:
Sandis replaced byCrimsand. Cacti drop ordinarycactuswhen cut, even though they have a different color.Waterleafis not able to grow in Crimson Deserts. If a Crimson biome overlaps a Desert biome during world generation, Sand will be converted to Crimsand, but it will not spread until Hardmode.
Crimson Chasmsfound inIce biome.
Like the Crimson desert, Crimson Snow biomes are created when a Crimson spreads into a Snow biome during Hardmode. Snow is not convertible, but Ice can be converted into Red Ice. Red Ice can be created during generation if a Crimson biome overlaps a Snow biome, but it will not spread until Hardmode.

The_Destroyer,"The Destroyeris aHardmodemechanical bosswhich is essentially a more difficult version of theEater of Worlds. Like the Eater of Worlds, it is a very largeworm. Although it appears to be similarly made up of many segments, individual segments cannot die, and The Destroyer will not split apart into multiple entities; its segments share a singular health pool. Like other worms, The Destroyer takes increased damage from attacks that damage multiple segments at once.
The Destroyer can be summoned manually using aMechanical Wormatnight(7:30PM to 4:30AM). It also has a10*1/10 (10%)chance to spawn naturally at dusk once aDemon or Crimson Altarhas been destroyed, as long as it has not yet been defeated at least once in the current world. If spawning this way, its arrival is announced by thestatus message""You feel vibrations from deep below..."".
Each of The Destroyer's segments fires lasers at the player. The red-lit segments contain aProbe, which is an independentflying enemythat is launched periodically as the boss takes damage and also fires lasers. Probes can be killed individually once detached, and never return to The Destroyer.
The Destroyer must be killed before dawn, otherwise it flees and despawns.
While The Destroyer is alive, the musicBoss 3https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_3.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackBoss 2 (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
The Destroyer spawns coiled up, like most worm enemies, and immediately uncoils and moves toward the player. It follows the player from any distance, and will only despawn if the player dies or if dawn comes (4:30AM). It quickly travels below the ground until it is off-screen, then despawns.
The Destroyer leaps from the ground and attempts to ram the player. It has limited mobility when fully in the air, requiring blocks or platforms to ""burrow"" through. It also attempts to surround the player, and if the player is too close to the ground it can usually succeed.
In addition, The Destroyer performs the following attacks:
A segment has a4*1/25 (4%)chance to release a Probe whenever it is damaged, but once a segment releases a probe, it cannot do it again.[1]The red light goes out when it releases the Probe. Probes will fly towards the player, attempting to maintain a distance while occasionally moving into melee range. They fire with moderate accuracy, able to reliably hit a stationary player. Probes do not die when the boss dies, so they may have to be killed even after The Destroyer has been defeated.

The_Hallow,"Crimson converted by the Hallow upon start of Hardmode.
Once you enter hallowed land, you will see a rainbow in the sky. I can help you with painting that if you want.
— ThePainter
The Hallowis aHardmodesurfacebiome. It is characterized by pastel-colored fairytale graphics, with colorful cyan-coloredgrass, multicoloredtrees, and a large rainbow in the background, as well as similarly whimsical-looking (though dangerous)enemies. TheUnderground Hallowbiome can be found directly beneath a naturally-generated Hallow biome.
The Hallow does not exist in newly-generated worlds. It is generated along with a largeUnderground Hallowbiome upon beating theWall of Fleshand enteringHardmode. This biome can replace preexisting sections of the world's ""evil biome"" (CorruptionorCrimson). If areas of Jungle or Glowing Mushroom biome are included in the conversion area,Stone Blockwill be converted but the (mud based) grasses will be unaffected.
Once generated, Hallowspreadsin a manner similar to the evil biomes;Pearlstone,Pearlsand, anddirtblocks growingHallowed grasswill spread Hallow to neighboringblocks, causing Hallow enemies to spawn over ever-larger areas. Hallow can also be seeded in new areas viaHallowed Seeds,Holy Water, orBlue Solution. See below or theBiome spreadpage for more details.
The Hallow, unlike Crimson and Corruption, cannot spread throughmudareas such as those found inJunglesorGlowing Mushroom biomes.
TheDryadcan tell the player the percentage of Hallow and Corruption/Crimson in the world.
The Hallow spreads itself, similar to theevil biomes. This means that it slowly converts certain susceptible tiles that are in the vicinity of existing Hallowed blocks. DefeatingPlanterafor the first time reduces the speed of the Hallow's spread by50*1/2 (50%). Hallowcanconvert Crimson and Corruption intograssblocks, but otherwise cannot convert blocks already claimed by an evil biome. This can result in areas where the Hallow and an evil biome intertwine closely. If Hallow is introduced into a pre-Hardmode world, its spread will be very limited, similarly to the evil biomes.
The Hallowed Desert.
When the Hallow spreads throughdesert, it becomes Hallowed Desert. It is very similar to the Hallow: the music theme is the same, the enemies are the same (except for theLight MummyandCrystal Thresher), and the background is slightly different.
Thesandis replaced bypearlsand. Although their color is different, Cacti still dropCactuswhen cut, andWaterleafplants are also able to grow.

The_Torch_God,"Torches attacking the player during The Torch God event. (The player is usingGodmodeto prevent taking damage.)
The Torch God event in a simple arena, with various colors of Torches, andGlowsticksto provide lighting.
The Torch Godis aneventthat is initiated by clustering a large number ofTorchesunderground, below theSurfacelayer. It consists of dodging projectiles, and survivors are rewarded with theTorch God's Favor, an item that gives the player the option for their Torches to automatically match thebiomethey are in. Making sure Torches match the biome type they are in will positively influence the player'sluckin most areas.
The event can begin once at least 101 Torches of any type are placed in close proximity below the Surface layer in any biome. It is possible for the event to start with less than 101 torches placed if the player is moving, due to the game's calculation incorrectly counting some Torches more than once. The Torch God will not begin for any character who has already consumed the Torch God's Favor or has one in their inventory.
As the Torch God begins, Dangerous torch flames shoot off at the player as projectiles, one at a time. They are fired randomly, at a rate of three per second. The fireballs deal 40 /80/120base damage,[1]and pass throughblocksto reach the player. After passing the player, they do collide with blocks, however. Each Torch shoots one fireball and extinguishes itself afterward as if it was switched off viawire. For the entire duration of the event, the player is inflicted with theBlackoutdebuff, significantly reducing their vision.
The Torch God ends once all nearby Torches have been spent, to a maximum of 200 attacks. If at least 95 Torches are fired, the player is rewarded with the Torch God's Favor item.[1]All Torches re-light when the event ends. If the player dies or leaves the area, the event ends early and nothing is awarded.

The_Twins,"""This is going to be a terrible night...""
The Twinsare aHardmodemechanical bossand are essentially a more difficult version of theEye of Cthulhu. The Twins are two separate flying entities,RetinazerandSpazmatism, connected by a tendril, each with its own attack pattern and life count. Both must be killed in order to defeat the boss.
The Twins can be summoned manually using aMechanical Eyeatnight(7:30PM to 4:30AM). They also have a10*1/10 (10%)chance to spawn naturally at dusk once aDemon or Crimson Altarhas been destroyed, as long as they have not yet been defeated at least once in the current world.

There are two eyes: Retinazer and Spazmatism. Retinazer is a laser-shooting eye with an orange iris; Spazmatism is a similar-textured eye, though it has a green iris. It fires green Cursed Flames.
Both alternate between their signature ranged attacks and charging melee attack, much like theEye of Cthulhu. Retinazer's charge attack has higher velocity but has longer periods between charges and does less charges than Spazmatism's.
Each eye has a second form, which each individually reaches upon its health dipping to 40%. Retinazer transforms at 8,000 /12,000/15,300HP while Spazmatism transforms at 9,200 /13,800/17,594HP.
InExpert Mode, Retinazer's laser firing becomes faster and charges cover more distance as its health depletes. Spazmatism's fireballs inflict Cursed Inferno for2×/2.5×the duration. Spazmatism also charges faster in its second form.

The_Underworld,"The Underworld(also known asHell) is the deepestlayerof the world. It is a large, open cavern that stretches across the bottom of the world, with a ceiling ofAsh Blocksand a lower terrain of largeLavapools,Ash Blocks, andHellstone. It also contains numerousRuined Houses, which are natural structures containing uniquefurnitureand loot. TheWall of Fleshbosscan be summoned in the Underworld; defeating it will cause the world to convert toHardmode.
The Underworld contains many hazards, such as large pools ofLavaand various difficultenemies.Hellstone, a valuable crafting material only obtainable in the Underworld, inflicts theBurningdebuffwhen touched and releases half a tile ofLavawhen mined. Further, because the Wall of Flesh is summoned by dropping aGuide Voodoo Dollinto Lava, killing aVoodoo Demonpositioned over Lava can inadvertently summon it.
The middle two-quarters of the Underworld contains severalRuined Houses, which are towers made fromObsidian Bricksand, less commonly,Hellstone Bricksthat containShadow Chests,Hellforges,Pots,Obsidian furniture, and other lootable items. Shadow Chests require theShadow Keyto open (acquired in theDungeon'sLocked Gold Chests,Golden Lock Boxes, or dropped fromArch Wyverns) and contain unique Underworld-only loot.

Tools,"Toolsare an association of items that are used to perform the various non-combat tasks involved inTerrariagameplay, such as construction and exploration, among others. Tools are generally wielded via the⚒Use / Attackkey while they are held as the activehotbaritem, and many also haveauto-use, allowing for continuous use via holding the⚒Use / Attackkey. Some tools inflict damage upon enemies, but are differentiated fromweapons, as this is not their primary use. Tools are also differentiated fromaccessories, which provide passive abilities, while tools are used proactively.
Pickaxes,Axes, andHammersare tools that are essential at all stages of gameplay for their ability to precisely dismantle world tiles, like placedblocks,background walls,plants, or placedfurniture, and convert them all to collectibleinventoryitems for re-placement in other locations, or for other uses, such ascrafting. They also double as weakmelee weaponsand generally inflict far less damage than actual weapons of corresponding tiers.
Other important tools include: theMagic Mirror, which will teleport the player back to theirspawn point;hooks, which aid travel above and below ground; theBucket, which transportsliquid; theBug Net, used to catchcritters; and theWrenches, used for constructingmechanisms. Many of these tools are generally used throughout all stages of the game.
Some tools have combined functionality:
Pickaxesanddrillsare used to remove/free placedblocks,background itemsorfurniturefor collection. When used on blocks, this is often referred to as ""mining"" or ""digging"". Their tier determines which types of blocks they can mine, as well as the number of hits it takes to remove each block type. Drills function identically to pickaxes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect. All tools to the right and below (and including itself) of theCobalt PickaxeareHardmode(3DSwith one exception; theDraxcan be obtained pre-Hardmode). The player begins with theCopper Pickaxewhen starting a new Classic character, and anIron Pickaxewhen starting a newJourneycharacter.
Axesandchainsawsare used to harvest backgroundplantsliketrees,cacti, andGiant Glowing Mushrooms(Woodblocks are removed with a pickaxe/drill instead). Chainsaws function identically to axes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect.Hamaxesfunction as both axes and hammers. The player begins with theCopper Axewhen starting a new Classic character, and anIron Axewhen starting a newJourneycharacter.
Hammersare used to freebackground wallsfor collection, to destroy background walls which cannot be collected, to shape foregroundblocksto create slopes and half-tiles, and to shapeplatforms. They are also used to destroyShadow OrbsandCrimson Hearts. ThePwnhammer,Hammush, andThe Axecan additionally be used inHardmodeto destroyAltars, which triggers the spawning of newHardmode ores.Journeycharacters start with anIron Hammer.
These items aid the player in placing and removingWire, as well as manipulatingActuators.
These items allow players to place or removepaint.
Hooksare used to surmount tall obstacles and negotiate gaps, by latching and hoisting the player onto remote surfaces.
Fishing polesare used forfishing.
The following item(s) below are unobtainable without hacks or cheats of some kind.
"
Traveling_Merchant,"TheTraveling Merchantis a uniqueNPCvendor who randomly visits the player's town for one day. His inventory is randomized and different every visit, selling 4–10 /4–12(average 5.47 /5.97; seebelowfor details) different items listedbelow. This amount is increased by 2 onCelebrationmk10worlds, and by 1 by using thePeddler's Satchel.
In order for the Traveling Merchant to spawn, at least 2 other NPCs must already be present. TheGuidecounts as one of these, but theOld ManandSkeleton Merchantdo not[1]. He will not spawn duringSolar Eclipses, theGoblin Army,Frost Legion,Pirate Invasion,Martian Madness[2]or if the chat is open. He does not require his ownhousein order to spawn, and will instead spawn next to NPCs, including town pets, spending the day walking around them.
Once the criteria are met, the Traveling Merchant has a 22.12% chance of spawning each day, appearing at a random time between 4:30AM and 12:00PM. The chances of him spawning are always the same regardless if the player is sleeping. He leaves the same day at 6:00PM, but can only do so once he is off-screen. He despawns if the world is vacated any time after he spawns.
If threatened byenemies, the Traveling Merchant will defend himself with aRevolver. OnceHardmodebegins, he upgrades to aPulse Bow.
Due to elaborate randomizer functions and dependencies upon several variables, it is nearly impossible to state an exact chance of an item being sold by the Traveling Merchant.[3]However, it is possible to group them in six rarity ""slots"", ranging from ""Common"" to ""Extraordinarily Rare"". Note that these slots do not correspond to the Traveling Merchant's shop inventory slots – all sold items may be from only one slot. They are only meant to provide a rough, comparative estimate of an item's rarity. Each shop slot will roll a 1/n chance of being for every possible item where n is 100 × the rarity slot. This chance is affected by the luckiest player currently in the world. Items that are always selected when another item is selected don't have their own chance being selected. All colored team blocks share the same chance of getting selected; if the chance succeeds, the color is randomly chosen. When multiple items pass this chance, the item that was tested, the latest will be the selected.
Within the slots, items higher in the list below have a marginally higher chance of being sold, e.g., theCompanion Cubeis sold slightly more often than theWater Gun(on average), because it is higher in the list.
The Traveling Merchant sells exactly one painting and has guaranteed slot for it.






The following tables list the chances of the numbers of items sold by the Traveling Merchant.[4]Only ""base"" items are counted, i.e.,Dynasty ShinglesandTeam Platformsare excluded from this number, since they are always sold together with their ""base"" items Dynasty Wood or Team Block, respectively. The selected amount is increased by 2 on Celebrationmk10 worlds.
These chances reveal that the average number of sold ""base"" items is 5.47 /5.97.

Underground,"The change of background that marks the end of the Underground layer and the beginning of the Cavern layer below it.
TheUndergroundis the firstlayerbelow thesurface. It fills the area between the Surface andCavernlayers, beginning at a depth of 0ft and extending downward.
The Underground can be recognized by its distinctive background, which no longer contains naturally-placedDirt Wallslike surface terrain, but instead displays a unique, often brown, backdrop with no naturally-placedwalls. Players cannot remove this backdrop using aHammer, nor can they place blocks in midair, as no wall generally exists here (though players can place their walls, just as they can above surface terrain). Natural Underground blocks are generally similar to those in the surface, withDirtandStonemaking up the majority of the biome.Clay,Silt, and lower-tiergemsandorescan also be found in small pockets here. Some miscellaneous treasures can be found here, includingGem Trees(which dropGemcorns,Stone, and occasionally their respectivegemswhen chopped down); dye plants includingGreen Mushrooms,Orange Bloodroot, andTeal Mushrooms; and theBlinkrootherb.
The Underground is home to more aggressiveenemiesthan the surface. More powerfulRedandYellow Slimeswill spawn down here (alongside the rarePinky), whileBlue Jellyfishspawn in the water andGiant Wormsare found burrowing through the ground. In Hardmode, more powerful counterparts of these enemies will spawn, with theDigger,Green Jellyfish, andToxic Sludgemostly replacing Giant Worms, Blue Jellyfish, and regularSlimesrespectively.
Trapswill also begin appearing in this layer. Underground Cabins, though not as common as in the Caverns, will frequently appear with handy loot such as theCloud in a Bottle,Hermes Boots, andMagic Mirror.
In general, not much time is spent here, but instead in the Cavern layer, which holds many more enemies, treasures, and unique drops. Therefore, it's a mostly wise idea to ignore this layer in favour of exploring the Caverns.
Occasionally, theMouseandSnailcritters will be found scurrying around. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version,Fairieshave a rare chance of randomly showing up and guiding the player to a random treasure (such asChests,Life Crystals, orOre) nearby.
True Underground versions ofbiomes, such as theIce biomeorUnderground Corruption, do not begin in this layer, but in theCavernlayer (except for theUnderground Desert, which begins in Surface terrain and extends through the Underground and a portion of the Cavern). InHardmode, some blocks in the Underground can be converted intoHallow,Corruption, orCrimson.
For more information, seeNPC happiness.

Underground_Corruption,"TheUnderground Corruptionis abiome. It is the underground version of thesurface-levelCorruption. Prior toHardmode, it will only naturally exist in the lowest parts ofChasms, and only if they are deep enough to reach theCavernlayer. Regardless, once theWall of Fleshis defeated, more Underground Corruption will be created at and below thecavernlayer. It operates similarly to surface Corruption, being composed ofEbonstoneandEbonsand, though it spawns different enemies in Hardmode.
Underground Corruption spreads just like surface Corruption, and similarly can not spread throughHallow. Additionally, onOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionversions ofTerraria, small pockets of Underground Corruption can be created through the breaking ofDemon Altars, which will convert a single random Stone Block in the world into Ebonstone upon its destruction.
Underground Corruption does not suppress the spawn of otherundergroundandcavernenemies. During Hardmode, all enemies killed in the Underground Corruption have a20*1/5 (20%)chance to drop aSoul of Night. InExpert Mode, this chance increases to a36*9/25 (36%)chance.

Underground_Desert,"A world view of an underground desert from 1.4 with aPyramidand anOasis.
TheUnderground Desertis abiomelocated directly underneath aDesertbiome. On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader versionthe Desert above may generate different features which informs that the Underground Desert is underneath, whereas on theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionthe Desert will always generate a large 'antlion funnel' which leads down into the Underground Desert. SeeSurface Desertbelow for details. The Desert/Underground Desert pair will always generate on the same side of the world theJungleis on.
The structure of the Underground Desert resembles that of a real-world ant hive, featuring numerous small caves mainly composed ofSandstone BlocksandHardened Sand Blocks, which are connected in varying degrees. It is very large when fully explored, rivaling even theDungeonin size, and is always either circular or oval in shape. The Underground Desert is inhabited by many types of Antlion enemies and is also riddled with traps, making it a challenge to navigate.
The Underground Desert becomes significantly more challenging inHardmode. Along with harder enemies, the Underground Desert is extremely vulnerable toconversionbyCorruption,Crimson, orHallowdue toSand,Hardened Sand, andSandstoneall being susceptible to conversion. Conversion further strengthens the Underground Desert's enemies, and in Corruption and Crimson Underground Deserts, causes the spawn ofDesert Spirits.

A Corrupted Underground Desert
A partially Hallowed Underground Desert
A world view of an underground desert from1.3with aPyramid. Note the largePit-type entrance.
On thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, the Desert above the Underground Desert may generate with various surface features, including one or moreOasismini-biomes, or one of several types of theentrance. There is a33.33*1/3 (33.33%)chance that a world's main Desert will contain one of the various types of the entrance. These can assist in locating and accessing the Underground Desert from thesurface. The presence of an Oasis does not indicate where the Underground Desert is, as the Oasis mini-biomes can generate atopanyof the world's Deserts, regardless of which of them contains the Underground Desert biome.
On theOld Chinese versionandtModLoader 1.3-Legacy version, the Desert above the Underground Desert willalwayscontain a large Pit-style entrance. This makes finding and accessing the Underground Desert from the surface very easy.
On all versions, it is possible for one or morePyramidsto generate in the main Desert. When this happens, the Pyramid will often extend somewhat into the Underground Desert, and thus its tunnel can provide another easy means of entry. As with theOasismini-biome, Pyramids can generate in any of the world's Deserts, regardless of where the Underground Desert is located, and so their presence does not guarantee that the Underground Desert is below.
SeeDesertfor more information about the surface entrances to the Underground Desert.
None of theUnderground Desert enemiesrequire an actualDesert biometo spawn. The three ""tainted"" Ghouls each only spawn in their respective Corrupt/Crimson/Hallowed biomes. When in an evil biome, dark-haired Lamia will replace their counterpart and Desert Spirits will replace Sand Poachers. Antlion Larvae only spawn when Antlion Eggs are broken.
To successfully spawn an enemy on a selected tile, the following checks are done:
"
Underground_Hallow,"TheUnderground Hallowis a dangerousHardmodebiome, being spawned when theWall of Fleshis defeated. It is the underground version of thesurface-levelHallow, and appears in theCavernlayer. It operates similarly to the surface Hallow, being comprised ofPearlstoneandPearlsand; though it spawns different enemies, along withCrystal Shards, a common Hardmode crafting material.Gelatin Crystalscan also be found to summonQueen Slime. The Underground Hallow spreads just like its surface counterpart, The Hallow, and similarly will conflict withCorruptionandCrimson, as well as their underground variants.
Underground Hallow does not suppress the spawn of otherundergroundandcavernenemies.
All enemies killed in the Underground Hallow have a20*1/5 (20%)chance to drop aSoul of Light. InExpert Mode, this chance increases to a36*9/25 (36%)chance.
Additionally, onOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionversions of Terraria, small pockets of Underground Hallow can be created through the breaking ofDemon/Crimson Altars, which have a66.67*2/3 (66.67%)chance to convert a single randomStone Blockin the world intoPearlstone.
Note:Most characteristics of the surface Hallow apply to the Underground Hallow, with the exception of the enemies that spawn. SeeThe Hallowfor more extensive information.

Common treasure rooms areJungle Shrines,Underground Cabins, andLiving Mahogany Trees.
InHardmode, all enemies have a chance of dropping aJungle Key() /Jungle Key Mold().
Furthermore, the Underground Jungle undergoes several minor changes throughout the course of Hardmode:
The Underground Jungle can be found directly underneath the surfaceJunglebiome. It starts around the middle of theUndergroundlayer, at these depths:

Upcoming_features,"Re-Logicstaff members occasionally announce and/or hint at various details ofTerrariaupdates that are still in development. This page lists those details.
Since the updates described here have not been released yet, and many of these details are only conjectured based on comments or screenshots provided by the staff, all items here may be subject to change, or may not end up in a futureTerrariaupdate at all.
Upcoming features policy:
WithJourney's Endbeing designed to be a conclusion toTerraria, no new major content updates are planned for thePC version. However, Re-Logic has stated that they would like to implement cross-play[1], allowingMultiplayerbetween thePC version,Console version, andMobile version. This will require feature parity between all three versions to function properly, as Cenx has stated[2]. As of now, Android and PC save files appear to be almost entirely compatible and interchangeable in 1.4.4, in contrast to previous versions. This might suggest that cross-play development is nearing completion.
Terraria will be having a crossover with the hack-and-slash metroidvania gameDead Cells. The update is set to release sometime around 2025.
In the past,Redigithas mentioned plans to releaseTerraria 2[3], a separate game from the cancelled[4]Terraria: Otherworld, although little information is known about the nature or content in the possible upcoming sequel at this time, including whether it still exists."
Vanity_items,"Vanity itemsare wearable items that can be equipped insocial slotsnext to thearmorandaccessoriesslots in a character'sinventory. Wearing them will change a character's appearance, but will not provide any functionality. Vanity items placed in the armor slots will also cover all armor appearances. Many of these vanity items are references to popular culture and other video games.
These sets can only be found inGoodie Bagsor fromNPCsduring the Halloween season.
These costumes can only be found inPresentsor fromNPCsduring the Christmas season.
These sets do not follow any season. They can be purchased fromNPCs, looted frombossesorenemies, looted duringevents, looted fromchests, or crafted by the player.
All bosses, includingOld One's Armyones, but notLepusandTurkor the Ungrateful, have a 14.29% chance to drop their respective mask.

The same hairstyle on a character shown in its flat version (left) and its original version (right).
Some head pieces in Terraria show the player's original hair under them, while others hide hair completely, even if that item does not cover the entirety of the player's head. When an item shows player hair, the game will either display the full hairstyle, or a variant of it that flattens the hair so it fits under headgear. This allows items such as the Wizard's Hat to also display the beard of a player. With the exception of the Wizard Hat, armor items generally do not show player hair. Note that, by default, the game hides player hair, so items not listed below hide player hair entirely."
Walls,"A character placing walls in a house.
Background walls, also just known aswalls, are tiles that create backgrounds on top ofbiome backgrounds. Walls are hidden behind everything else, such asblocks. Natural walls are generated atworldcreation, being abundant in certain biomes like theUnderground Jungle, and are of the main components aTerrariaworld consists of alongside blocks andliquids. Walls can be removed with ahammerorexplosives. Flammable walls can also be destroyed by fire or lava. There are currently 250 obtainable walls.
Many wall types exist as items that the player can place in theirinventoryand then re-place in any area which does not already have walls. Certain mechanics of walls is dependent on which of the following categories they fall under:
Distinguishing safe walls from unsafe walls can be tricky because many walls, such asObsidian Brick WallsorDungeon Brick Walls, exist in both safe and unsafe forms. With these walls (both of which are harvestable), the player must break the unsafe walls and replace them in order for them to count as safe walls. Similarly, many (or all, on) naturally-generated walls have safe counterparts which are obtainable through crafting or purchase from NPCs.
These walls are made by the player using variouscrafting materials. All crafted walls qualify for housing.
These walls are purchased from variousNPCs. All purchased walls qualify for housing.
These walls can be harvested in various places when exploring theworld. Most of them can also be obtained through crafting. All harvested walls qualify for housing.
These walls are normally created bybiome spread. They can also be made usingSolutionsprayed with theClentaminatoror theTerraformer, and on thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader versionthey can also be crafted or purchased (with the exception of the natural Mushroom Wall). On theOld-gen console version,Windows Phone version,Old Chinese version,Nintendo3DSversion, andtModLoader 1.3-Legacy versionthe Clentaminator is the only way the player can make these walls. These walls qualify for housing when they are crafted or purchased, but not if they are created by biome spread or the Clentaminator.
The backdrop of theUndergroundandCavernlayers is a non-removablebiome backgroundwhich does not consist of wall tiles."
Wall_of_Flesh,"
A player facing the Wall of Flesh.
TheWall of Fleshis the final and strongestpre-Hardmodeboss, spawnable only inThe Underworld. Once it is defeated, the world permanently converts toHardmode, which brings new content and challenges. This means that once the Wall is defeated, new biomes will spawn, new monsters will attack you, and the game can be beaten.
To defeat the Wall of Flesh, the player must attack either its eyes or its mouth. They all share the same life counter, so attacking any of the two will deplete the total health of the boss. However, the eyes have less defense (thus take more damage) than the mouth. No other parts of the Wall can be damaged.
See below for information on the two exclusivedebuffsfrom the boss,HorrifiedandThe Tongue.
While the Wall of Flesh is alive, the musicBoss 2https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Boss_2.mp3will play. WhenOtherworldly musicis enabled, the trackWall of Flesh (Otherworldly)https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music-Wall_of_Flesh_(Otherworldly).mp3will play instead.
The Wall of Flesh is summoned immediately75 blocks away from all visible playerswhen aGuide Voodoo Dollis destroyed by being dropped intolavain the Underworld while theGuideis alive, killing the Guide. Dropping the doll into lava outside of Underworld, regardless if the Guide is alive, will not spawn it, and the Voodoo Doll is destroyed with no effect. In thePC version,Console version,Mobile version, andtModLoader version, the Wall of Flesh can also be summoned by letting the Guide be killed in the Underworld while the Guide is in contact with lava. Using this method, the Guide can die by any means, either from a player, an enemy or the environment, as long as he is touching lava when he dies.[1]If aMediumcoreplayer dies in lava (in the Underworld, and Guide is alive) with a Guide Voodoo Doll in their inventory, the Wall of Flesh is summoned.
The Wall of Flesh's sweep direction is determined by its spawn location. Spawning it on either side of the world will cause it to sweep in the opposite direction (regardless of the direction the Doll was thrown). Maximum fight space can be achieved by spawning it at the extreme right or left of the world, though these areas have fewernatural structuresand may require additional lava survival gear or construction. Be aware of the fact that The Wall of Flesh might not fight but just leave the battle if you spawn it too close to the edge.
The Wall of Flesh will spawn level with the tile of lava that destroys the Guide Voodoo Doll, then begins adjusting to the player's current tile height, though there is a limit to this. Digging a tunnel near the bottom of the world can leave the player unable to deal damage to the Wall of Flesh, and it's recommended such setups stay relatively near to the Underworld's surface elevation.
The Wall of Flesh is very large, occupying the entire screen vertically. Once spawned, it slowly sweeps across the map in a single direction, forcing the player to constantly move away for the duration of the fight, while also contending with the Underworld's usual hazards, if possible. It must be killed before it reaches the other end of the map, otherwise, it will despawn and all players in The Underworld will die (with the uniquedeath message"""").
Once the Wall of Flesh has spawned, all players within 1800feet will be inflicted with theHorrified debuff. The debuff lasts until either the player or the Wall of Flesh dies. If a player dies and then returns to the battle, they will again be inflicted with the debuff. While this debuff is active, players cannot flee the battle, i.e. attempting to escape the Underworld via aMagic/Ice Mirror,Cell Phone,Magic Conch,Shellphone(unless if the destination is the Underworld),Recall Potion,Teleporter, or running far ahead of the Wall and leaving, will cause the player to die instantly with the unique death message""<Player name> tried to escape.""Exiting the game and re-entering the world allows for escape, but causes the Wall of Flesh to despawn.
Attempting to leave the Underworld or to get behind the Wall of Flesh will inflictThe Tongue debuff. When it is activated, a tendril will snatch the player and draw them into the Wall of Flesh's mouth up to a speed of 56 mph, ignoringblocksin the way, and dealing high damage to the player (50 damage per second). The player will be unable to move or use items while the debuff is active.
The Wall of Flesh moves faster as its health depletes, increasing in speed after reaching 75% (6000 /8400/10710), 50% (4000 /5600/7140), 25% (2000 /2800/3570), and 10% (800 /1120/1428) of its health. InExpert Mode, it accelerates even further with additional increases at 66% (7392/9424), 33% (3696/4712), 5% (560/714), 3.5% (392/499), and 2.5% (280/357) maximum health.[2]At extremely low health levels, it can reach up to 41mphinClassic Modeand 50 mph inExpert Mode(as compared to theHermes Bootsat 30mph,Lightning Bootsat 34 mph, and theBunny Mountat 39 mph).
Additionally:
When the Wall of Flesh is killed, it leaves itsdropsin a midair frame ofDemonite BricksforCorruptionworlds, orCrimtane BrickforCrimsonworlds. It will always drop thePwnhammer, which is required to breakAltarsand generateHardmodeores in the world.
After defeating the Wall of Flesh for the first time, thestatus message""The ancient spirits of light and dark have been released.""displays and the world permanently converts to Hardmode. Hardmode brings newbiomes,new and tougher enemies, and a vast array of new equipment.
Two diagonal stripes ofHallowandCorruptionorCrimsonform in a ""V"" pattern from the center of the Underworld, all the way to thesurface. These biomes will also begin to spread to more blocks and spread at a much faster rate, eventually covering large areas of the world if no action is taken.

Weapons,"Weaponsare essential items used for combat againstenemies,bosses, critters, and even other players duringPvPgames. Some weapons can be crafted at aWork Benchor aPre-Hardmode/Hardmode Anvil, while others can only be found inChests, as enemy drops, or purchased fromNPCs.Terrariahas a wide variety of weapons and weapon classes, each suited to particular play styles or specific tasks.
Mosttoolscan also be used as weapons, despite it not being their primary purpose.Traps, self-defendingNPCs, and evenlava, although not primarily weapons, can be considered a weapon if somehow used in combat.
Swordsare melee weapons which can be divided into 2 basic categories: shortswords and broadswords.
Shortswords have very limited range, and they attack with a horizontal stabbing motion instead of an arc. OnPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, they act more similarly to spears, being able to stab in more directions. Broadswords are swung overhead, which makes it easier to defeat flying and jumping enemies.
Yoyosare flail-like melee weapons that follow the player's cursor when thrown.
Spearsare melee weapons that have a longer range than most swords, but attack with a stabbing motion. Spears also can hit targets more than once, making them especially useful for dealing with  large enemies.
Boomerangsare melee weapons that return to the player after being thrown. Together with yoyos, they provide the earliest distance attacks that benefit from melee bonuses.
Flailsare melee weapons that consist of an object linked to the player by a chain, which can either be thrown or fired. Thrown flails can be suspended around the player indefinitely, whereas launched flails immediately return to the player.
These are melee weapons that possess unique means of attack. Some also launch projectiles.
Bowsare ranged weapons that firearrowsasammunition. Although several bows deal no knockback, most arrows do.
Repeatersare ranged weapons that fire arrows as ammunition, similar to bows. All repeaters are Hardmode-exclusive.
Gunsare a type of ranged weapon that usebulletsas ammo.
Launchersare Hardmode-exclusive ranged weapons that firerocketsand similar explosive ammunition.
Consumable ranged weapons do not require ammunition and are consumed upon use.
Note: The Confetti Gun, Slime Gun, and Water Gun are novelty weapons, causing nodamageorknockback. The Confetti Gun is a consumable, and can only be used once. The Slime Gun and Water Gun cause purely aesthetic debuffs and cannot be placed on aWeapon Rack.
Wands are magic weapons that are mainly used to deal damage via a projectile attack.
These weapons summon minions to attack enemies.
These weapons summon sentries to attack enemies, though sentries do not move like minions.
Whips are weapons that when used swing out at certain distances similar to theSolar Eruption."
Windy_Day,"The wind blows with the leaves, the leaves blow with the wind.
—The Witch Doctor
AWindy Dayis aneventthat occurs when thewind speedsurpasses 20 mph. The event will stop when the wind speed decreases past 16 mph. The wind can either come from the east or the west, making background objects like trees, vines, plants, banners and lanterns sway in the same direction. During this event,ladybugscan spawn intowns.
Windy Days have a few unique enemies, such asslimes attached to flying balloonsandAngry Dandelions. During the event certain enemies have a chance to dropKitesand theMerchantwill sell thePin Wheel."
Wings,"Be it what it would, a jetpack would suit you nicely!
— TheSteampunker
WingsareHardmode(with the exception of Fledgling Wings)accessoriesthat can allow the player to fly temporarily by pressing and holding the↷Jumpkey. Flight time is reset when the player rests on solid objects, including both standing on blocks and using climbing items likeRopes,Hooks,Shoe Spikes,Climbing Claws, andTiger Climbing Gear/Master Ninja Gear. Certain wings also allow the player to hover at fixed heights by holding the▼ Downkey during flight, and/or accelerate their ascent speed by holding the▲ Upkey.
After flight time has been exhausted, a player can continue holding the↷Jumpkey to glide. Gliding fall speed can be accelerated by holding the▼ Downkey in addition.
Wings additionally grant immunity fromfall damage(except when overridden by theStoneddebuff, which nullifies fall damage protection items like theLucky Horseshoe.)
Flight is much more controlled with wings than withRocket Boots,Spectre Boots, etc. alone, and they allow for much greater flight range. Equipping wings generally replaces jumps entirely with flight, rather than requiring a double-jump to activate. However, the wings stack with the flight ofRocket Bootsand its upgrades. Double-jump accessories like theCloud in a Bottlewill still grant an additional jump, which is used after all flight time.
There are currently 47 uniquewing typesin total: 45 are available onPC,Console,Mobile, andtModLoader, 39 ontModLoader Legacy, and 21 onOld-gen console,Windows Phone, and3DS. Flight time and speed can vary by the version.
Wings have a variety of origins: Some can be crafted, a few can be purchased outright, one is anAnglerreward, a few are dropped directly frombosses, and Fledgling Wings are gifted to every newJourney Modecharacter or found inSkyware ChestsandSky Crates/Azure Crates
InExpert Mode, more wings can come as part ofTreasure Bags: Each Hardmode Treasure Bag has a5*1/20 (5%)chance to drop a random set ofdeveloper items, and all sets include wings (with the exception ofAaron's set).
Most craftable wings are crafted at aHardmode Anvil: Most require 20Souls of Flightand a core item determining the wing type. This core item can be a rare enemy drop with no other use (Such as theGiant Harpy Featherfor the Harpy Wings), or a quantity of material representing a new stage of the game(Such asShroomite Barsfor the Hoverboard).
The four lunar wings (Solar Wings,Vortex Booster,Nebula Mantle, andStardust Wings) are instead crafted like other endgame equipment: At theAncient ManipulatorfromLuminite BarsandLunar Fragments; they do not require Souls of Flight.
All wings can be sold for8, except for the Leaf Wings (30/20), Steampunk Wings (60/20) and Fledgling Wings (4).

Wizard,"TheWizardis aHardmodeNPCvendor who sellsmagic-related items. As soon as theWall of Fleshhas been defeated, he rarely spawns in thecavernlayer or below. Similar to theGoblin Tinkerer,Mechanic,Golfer,Tavernkeep, andStylist, he first spawns as the stationaryBound Wizard. Interacting with him will free him, after which he will respawn as long as a vacanthouseis available, even if killed.
Whenenemiesare in his vicinity, the Wizard hurls fireballs at them in a similar fashion to theFlower of Firewhile casting an aesthetic magic circle, dealing 18 /27/31damage.

Workshop_Hub,"The banner used in the1.4.2changelog.
TheWorkshop Hubis a menu option inTerrariawhich allows players to toggle/importworldsorResource Packsinstalled from theSteam Workshopor from a local file.
The Workshop Hub can be accessed via the main menu by pressing the ""Workshop"" button, but only while playing on a Steam copy of the game. While playing on a GOG.com copy of the game, the button will be replaced with ""Resource Packs"", which opens the ""Use Resource Packs"" menu directly.
TheImport Worldsscreen shows a list of the players currently subscribed Steam Workshop worlds. Each item in the list shows data like the worlds name, creation date, difficulty and size. Unlike theSelect Worldmenu, only one button exists to ""Import"" the selected world, making a unique copy of it with a set name.
TheUse Resource Packsscreen shows a list of available Resource Packs the player has installed, either via theirResourcePacksfolder or from the Steam Workshop. Packs subscribed through Steam Workshop will have theSteam icon on the upper-right corner of the item. The player can view the description of each pack or enable them, ordered from most to least significance. Packs on the top of the Enabled Packs list will overwrite the packs below them and all enabled packs can be reordered with the arrow buttons.
ThePublish WorldsandPublish Resource Packsscreens show a list of the player's current worlds or loaded resource packs, allowing them to publish to the Steam Workshop.

On theWindows Phone versionandNintendo3DSversion, the player can select either ""normal"" or ""expanded"". The worlds are smaller due to less memory. A""expanded"" world is the equivalent of a""small"" world.
Dimensions of the different map sizes are as follows: (one tile = two feet)
World size has a notable impact on how many of a certain structure may be generated in the world. The values listed below are the theoretical maximums and not a guaranteed count. Although unlikely, some large structures and biomes can be skipped if no proper placement is found. Additionally, some smaller structures can be overwritten by other structures, or be blocked by other nearby structures. The ranges listed are based on chance factors during generation and not on observed data.
Different world sizes may be better suited for different purposes. Players may find that creating many small worlds may be more efficient than creating large worlds due to the amount of memory needed.
